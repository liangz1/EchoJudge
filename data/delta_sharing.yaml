            Delta Sharing is an open protocol developed by Databricks for secure data sharing
            with other organizations or teams within your organization, regardless of the
            computing platforms they use. It allows users of any table registered in Unity Catalog
            to share data securely. Delta Sharing enables secure data sharing by providing a
            protocol for sharing data with other organizations or teams, ensuring data security
            and compatibility across different computing platforms. It is designed to facilitate
            secure data sharing and collaboration while maintaining data governance and security
            standards.

            ## Delta Sharing: Secure Data Sharing Across Platforms

            Delta Sharing is an **open protocol** developed by Databricks for **securely sharing data
            with other organizations**, regardless of the computing platforms they use. It essentially
            allows you to share a slice of your data, like a table or partition, while keeping the full
            dataset under your control.

            Here's how it enables secure data sharing:

            **1. Access Control:**

            * **Fine-grained permissions:** You can control who can access your data by setting read-only
              permissions for specific users or groups, ensuring unauthorized access is blocked.
            * **Identity and authentication:**  Delta Sharing integrates with authentication systems like
              Azure Active Directory and Okta, ensuring trusted access and auditability.

            **2. Data Isolation:**

            * **Read-only shares:** Recipients can only view and analyze the shared data, not modify it.
              This protects your original dataset from accidental or malicious changes.
            * **Secure storage:** The data stays in your cloud storage (like S3, ADLS, or GCS), encrypted
              at rest and in transit.

            **3. Open Protocol:**

            * **Platform agnostic:** Recipients can access your data through various tools and platforms, 
              like pandas, Apache Spark, and others, without needing to use your specific software.
              This promotes broader collaboration and analysis.
            * **Open source implementation:** The protocol is publicly available and open-source,
              fostering adoption and trust.

            **Benefits of using Delta Sharing:**

            * **Faster collaboration:** Simplify data sharing with partners and external stakeholders,
              facilitating quicker insights and improved decision-making.
            * **Reduced costs:** Eliminate the need for data replication and unnecessary infrastructure
              setups, saving resources.
            * **Enhanced security:** Maintain control over your data while providing secure access to
              authorized users.
            * **Increased data utilization:** Make your data more valuable by empowering others to analyze
              and leverage it in different ways.

            In summary, Delta Sharing offers a secure and efficient way to share data with anyone,
            regardless of their platform, while keeping your original dataset safe and under your control.
            This open approach promotes collaboration and unlocks the full potential of data analysis across
            different organizations.

            I hope this explanation helps! Feel free to ask any further questions you might have about Delta Sharing.

                Today, weâ€™re launching a new open source project that simplifies cross-organization sharing:
                Delta Sharing, an open protocol for secure real-time exchange of large datasets, which enables
                secure data sharing across products for the first time.
            - >-
                Benefits of the design
                The Delta Sharing design provides many benefits for both providers and consumers:
                Data Providers can easily share an entire table, or just one version or partition of the table,
                because clients are only given access to a specific subset of the objects in it.

                Delta Sharing is also available as an open-source project that you can use to share Delta
                tables from other platforms.

                Delta Sharing is an open protocol for secure real-time exchange of large datasets, which
                enables organizations to share data in real time regardless of which computing platforms they use.
            - >-
                With Delta Sharing, a user accessing shared data can directly connect to it through pandas,
                Tableau, Apache Spark, Rust, or other systems that support the open protocol, without
                having to deploy a specific compute platform first.
