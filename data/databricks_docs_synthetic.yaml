            The Delta Sharing server supports several unique features that are not
            typically supported in other protocols. These include:


            1. Unified Data Access: Delta Sharing enables unified access to data across
            different data sources and formats, eliminating the need for separate
            connectors or protocols for each source. It allows users to access a wide
            range of data formats and sources including data lakes, data warehouses,
            and other systems.


            2. Secure Data Sharing: Delta Sharing provides built-in security mechanisms
            that ensure secure data sharing. It supports authentication and authorization
            through integration with existing identity providers, enabling fine-grained
            access control to data.


            3. Query Pushdown: Delta Sharing allows query pushdown, which means that
            the server can push down the execution of certain operations to the data
            source itself. This optimizes performance by reducing data movement and
            processing on the client side.


            4. Schema Evolution: Delta Sharing supports schema evolution, allowing
            the schema of shared data to evolve over time without breaking existing
            queries or applications. It provides compatibility checks and handles
            schema evolution seamlessly.


            5. Incremental Data Sharing: Delta Sharing supports incremental data sharing,
            where only the changed or delta data is shared instead of the entire dataset.
            This reduces data transfer and storage costs, especially for large datasets
            that are frequently updated.


            6. Data Versioning: Delta Sharing maintains version history of shared
            data, allowing users to access and query past versions of the data. This
            is particularly useful for auditing, compliance, and data lineage purposes.


            7. Data Consistency Guarantees: Delta Sharing ensures strong consistency
            guarantees for shared data, maintaining the ACID properties (Atomicity,
            Consistency, Isolation, Durability) during data sharing operations. This
            ensures data integrity and reliability.


            8. Data Catalog Integration: Delta Sharing integrates with data catalogs,
            such as the Delta Lake catalog, enabling easy discovery and exploration
            of shared data. It provides metadata about the shared datasets, facilitating
            data governance and catalog management.


            These unique features make Delta Sharing a powerful and versatile protocol
            for enabling secure and efficient data sharing across different systems
            and formats.

            Delta Sharing is an open protocol for secure, real-time sharing of large
            datasets, which was designed by Databricks. It is primarily focused on
            sharing data across different organizations and platforms, aiming to simplify
            and enhance the efficiency of data sharing processes. Delta Sharing has
            several key features that distinguish it from other data sharing protocols:


            1. **Open Format and Protocol**: Unlike proprietary data sharing solutions,
            Delta Sharing is based on an open protocol. This means any data platform
            can implement the protocol to share data with others, fostering interoperability
            and reducing vendor lock-in.


            2. **Real-Time Data Sharing**: Delta Sharing allows for the sharing of
            data in real-time. When the data is updated at the source, these changes
            can be immediately available to all the data consumers. This is particularly
            important for use cases where timely data is crucial.


            3. **Support for Large Datasets**: It is built to handle very large datasets
            efficiently. This includes optimizations for transferring large amounts
            of data over the network, such as sending data in parquet format, which
            is highly compressed and structured, making it ideal for efficient transmission
            and analytics.


            4. **Secure Sharing Mechanism**: The protocol includes built-in support
            for secure data sharing. This means that data providers can share data
            with specific consumers securely, using mechanisms like pre-signed URLs,
            which ensures that only authorized users can access the data.


            5. **Platform Agnostic**: Delta Sharing can work across multiple cloud
            providers and platforms. This is because it's based on simple HTTP/HTTPS
            protocols for data transmission, making it widely compatible with various
            data storage and analytics services.


            6. **Schema Enforcement and Evolution**: It supports schema enforcement
            and evolution, meaning that the structure of shared datasets can be strictly
            controlled and evolved over time without breaking consumers. This is critical
            for ensuring data quality and consistency across different systems.


            7. **Efficient Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Delta Sharing enables efficient
            sharing of changes to the data (CDC), allowing consumers to only download
            the data that has changed since their last access, which significantly
            reduces network traffic and speeds up data synchronization.


            8. **Access Control at the File Level**: Unlike some protocols that operate
            at the database or table level, Delta Sharing can control access down
            to the file level within datasets. This granular level of access control
            allows for more nuanced data sharing and privacy configurations.


            9. **Integration with Delta Lake**: Given its origins within Databricks,
            Delta Sharing is designed to work seamlessly with Delta Lake, providing
            optimizations for sharing Delta Lake tables, including transaction log
            management for consistency and atomicity.


            These features make Delta Sharing particularly suited for scenarios involving
            the sharing of large, frequently updated datasets across different organizations
            and platforms, with a strong emphasis on security, efficiency, and interoperability.

            cataloging, ensuring that data sharing complies with organizational policies
            and regulatory requirements.


            4. **Auditing**: Provides comprehensive auditing features, allowing organizations
            to track data access, modifications, and sharing activities, thereby enhancing
            security and compliance.


            5. **Usage Tracking for Both Providers and Recipients**: Enables monitoring
            of how shared data is being used by both the data providers and the recipients.
            This feature is crucial for understanding data access patterns, optimizing
            data sharing practices, and ensuring accountability.


            6. **Integration with Unity Catalog**: Simplifies the setup and governance
            of data sharing for both providers and recipients. This integration also
            improves performance by leveraging Unity Catalog's capabilities for data
            organization and access management.

            In Delta Sharing, a share is a read-only collection of tables and table
            partitions that a provider wants to share with one or more recipients.
            If the recipient uses a Unity Catalog-enabled Databricks workspace, notebook
            files, views, and Unity Catalog volumes can also be included in a share.
            Tables, views, volumes, and notebook files can be added or removed from
            a share at any time, and data recipient access can be assigned or revoked
            at any time. In a Unity Catalog-enabled Databricks workspace, a share
            is a securable object registered in Unity Catalog. If a share is removed
            from the Unity Catalog metastore, all recipients of that share lose the
            ability to access it.

            In Delta Sharing, a share refers to a unit of data that is made available
            for consumption by external entities or applications. It represents a
            specific set of data, such as a table, a database, or a collection of
            files, that can be accessed by authorized users or systems. Shares in
            Delta Sharing allow data producers to securely and efficiently share their
            data with consumers, enabling seamless data exchange and collaboration
            across different organizations or platforms.

            In Delta Sharing, a share is a read-only collection of tables and table
            partitions that a provider wants to share with one or more recipients.
            It allows the provider to share data in a controlled and secure manner.
            Additionally, if the recipient is using a Unity Catalog-enabled Databricks
            workspace, the share can also include notebook files, views (including
            dynamic views that restrict access at the row and column level), and Unity
            Catalog volumes. Providers have the flexibility to add or remove tables,
            views, volumes, and notebook files from a share at any time. They can
            also assign or revoke data recipient access to a share as needed. In a
            Unity Catalog-enabled Databricks workspace, a share is a securable object
            registered in Unity Catalog. If a share is removed from the Unity Catalog
            metastore, all recipients lose access to it.

            In Delta Sharing, a share is a top-level container used to organize datasets.
            It contains one or more databases that in turn contain tables. The share
            is the unit of access control, meaning permissions are granted at the
            share level.

            Delta Sharing is a protocol designed to facilitate secure and scalable
            data sharing across organizations in real-time, even if they are using
            different computing platforms or technologies. It is closely associated
            with Delta Lake, an open-source storage layer that brings ACID (Atomicity,
            Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions to Apache Spark and big
            data workloads. The idea behind Delta Sharing is to make it easier for
            users to share data across different data platforms without having to
            move or copy the data itself, thus ensuring efficiency, security, and
            compliance.


            In the context of Delta Sharing, a "share" can be understood as a collection
            of datasets (tables) that an organization decides to make available to
            other organizations or users. It acts like a container or a folder that
            groups together related datasets for sharing purposes. When an organization
            creates a share, it can then add datasets to this share and manage permissions,
            dictating who can access the data, whether they can only read it or also
            write to it, and so forth.


            Shares are a fundamental concept in Delta Sharing because they enable
            fine-grained access control and management of shared data. By organizing
            datasets into shares, data providers can easily manage what data is available
            for sharing, and with whom, while also applying the necessary security
            and governance policies to ensure the data is used appropriately and in
            compliance with regulations.

            This collection can also include notebook files, views (including dynamic

            volumes if the recipient uses a Unity Catalog-enabled Databricks workspace.
            Shares allow for the controlled dissemination of data, where the provider
            can add or remove tables, views, volumes, and notebook files from a share
            at any time, as well as assign or revoke data recipient access to the
            share whenever necessary. In environments that support Unity Catalog,
            a share is treated as a securable object registered within Unity Catalog,
            meaning if a share is removed from the Unity Catalog metastore, all recipients
            lose their access to it. This framework facilitates secure and flexible
            data sharing between entities.

            A recipient in Unity Catalog is an entity that receives shares from a
            provider. In Unity Catalog, a share is a securable object that represents
            an organization and associates it with a credential or secure sharing
            identifier that allows that organization to access one or more shares.
            Recipients can have access to multiple shares, and if a provider deletes
            a recipient from their Unity Catalog metastore, that recipient loses access
            to all shares it could previously access. This information is important
            for understanding the sharing and access control mechanisms in Unity Catalog.

            In Unity Catalog, a recipient typically refers to an entity (such as a
            user, group, or service) that has been granted access or permissions to
            a specific resource or dataset within the Unity Catalog environment. Unity
            Catalog is part of Databricks, and it serves as a unified governance solution
            for data and AI, enabling organizations to manage data across various
            platforms and cloud providers securely and efficiently.


            When you grant access or permissions to a recipient in Unity Catalog,
            you are allowing that recipient to perform certain actions on the resources
            they have been given access to. These actions could range from viewing
            and querying data to managing the data or even sharing it with others,
            depending on the level of permissions granted.


            Recipients can be managed through Unity Catalog's governance and security
            features, ensuring that only authorized users or services can access sensitive
            data. This is crucial for maintaining data privacy and compliance with
            various data protection regulations.


            It's important to note that the specific terminology and functionalities
            can evolve, so it's always a good idea to refer to the latest Databricks
            documentation for the most current information regarding Unity Catalog
            and its features.

            In the context of Unity Catalog within Databricks, a recipient is an entity—such
            as a user, group, or organization—that receives shares from a provider.
            A share, in this context, is a securable object within Unity Catalog that
            represents an organization and associates it with a set of data or resources.
            This association is facilitated through a credential or a secure sharing
            identifier, enabling the recipient to access the shared data or resources.


            The concept of recipients and shares in Unity Catalog is central to the
            platform's data sharing capabilities. Providers, who own or control data,
            can create shares to securely distribute data to recipients. Each recipient
            is defined within the context of a Unity Catalog metastore, and a provider
            can define multiple recipients to receive different shares. If a provider
            wants to share data from multiple metastores with a single user or a group,
            they must define the recipient separately for each metastore, as recipients
            are tied to the specific metastore context in which they are defined.


            Recipients can have access to multiple shares, depending on how the provider
            has configured the sharing arrangements. However, if a provider decides
            to delete a recipient from their Unity Catalog metastore, that recipient

            In summary, a recipient in Unity Catalog is an entity designated to receive
            and access data shared by a provider, with the specifics of this access
            defined by how the provider sets up the share within the Unity Catalog
            environment.

            Open Delta Sharing allows data providers to share data with users outside
            of their Databricks workspace, regardless of whether they use Databricks.
            Data providers generate a token and securely share it with the recipient,
            who uses the token to authenticate and gain read access to the tables
            included in the shares. Recipients can access the shared data using various
            computing tools and platforms, including Databricks, Apache Spark, Pandas,
            and Power BI. Open Delta Sharing provides a secure way to share data with
            external users and enables cross-platform data access.

            Open Delta Sharing is a technology developed by Facebook that enables
            the secure and efficient sharing of large-scale machine learning (ML)
            models and data between organizations. It is designed to address the challenges
            of distributing and collaborating on ML models while ensuring privacy
            and data protection.


            Open Delta Sharing allows organizations to securely share their ML models
            without the need to expose or transfer the underlying data. Instead, the
            models are transformed into a compact representation called a "delta"
            that captures the knowledge of the model without revealing sensitive data.
            This delta can then be shared with other organizations, enabling collaboration
            and knowledge transfer while maintaining privacy.


            By using Open Delta Sharing, organizations can benefit from improved model
            accuracy, reduced development time, and increased collaboration opportunities.
            It also provides a privacy-preserving solution by ensuring that sensitive
            data remains protected throughout the sharing process.

            Open Delta Sharing, often referred to in the context of data sharing and
            analytics, is a concept that emerges from the Delta Lake project. Delta
            Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings reliability to data lakes.
            It provides ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unifies
            streaming and batch data processing atop existing data lake storage systems
            like HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), S3 (Amazon Simple Storage
            Service), and others.


            As of my last update in April 2023, the term "Open Delta Sharing" specifically
            might refer to a combination of two concepts: the openness of the Delta
            Lake project (since it is open-source) and its capability to share data
            efficiently.


            1. **Delta Sharing**: Introduced by the Delta Lake project, Delta Sharing
            is an open protocol for securely sharing data across organizations in
            real-time, regardless of which computing platforms the organizations are
            using. This makes it easier for different systems and tools to access
            and query large datasets without needing to copy or move the data. It
            supports sharing data across various data lake platforms and cloud providers,
            enhancing interoperability and accessibility.


            2. **Open Source**: The Delta Lake project, including its sharing capabilities,
            is open source. This means its source code is publicly available for anyone
            to inspect, modify, and distribute. Open-source projects encourage community
            contributions, leading to rapid innovation, improved security through
            transparency, and reduced costs for users.


            Combining these concepts, "Open Delta Sharing" can be understood as an
            initiative or feature within the Delta Lake ecosystem that emphasizes
            the secure, efficient, and open sharing of data across different organizations
            and platforms. It leverages the reliability and performance improvements
            of Delta Lake while ensuring that data sharing is accessible and interoperable
            across a wide range of systems, contributing to a more collaborative and
            open data community.

            Databricks-to-Databricks Delta Sharing is a feature provided by Databricks
            that allows users to easily share and collaborate on Delta Lake tables
            across different Databricks workspaces or accounts. It enables users to
            securely share and access data without the need for data movement or replication.


            With Databricks-to-Databricks Delta Sharing, data producers can publish

            These tables can then be accessed by consumers who have access to the
            provider. Consumers can read, query, and even subscribe to changes in
            these shared tables, enabling real-time collaboration and data sharing.


            This feature provides a unified data sharing experience, allowing different
            teams or organizations to work with shared data seamlessly. It offers
            a secure and scalable way to share data without the overhead of data movement,
            reducing duplication and data inconsistencies.


            Databricks-to-Databricks Delta Sharing is built on Delta Lake, which adds
            reliability and transactional capabilities to data lakes. It ensures data
            integrity and consistency while enabling efficient data sharing and collaboration.

            and auditing, are handled by Delta Sharing and the Databricks platform.


            Additionally, Databricks-to-Databricks sharing allows you to share Databricks
            notebook files, views, and Unity Catalog volumes. It provides a convenient
            and secure way to collaborate and exchange data between different Databricks
            accounts or within your own account.

            Databricks-to-Databricks Delta Sharing is a feature that allows you to
            share data with users who have a Databricks workspace that is enabled
            for Unity Catalog. This feature enables you to share data with users in
            other Databricks accounts, whether they’re on AWS, Azure, or GCP. It's
            also used for securely sharing data across different Unity Catalog metastores
            in your own Databricks account. One key advantage is that the share recipient
            doesn’t need a token to access the share, and the provider doesn’t need
            to manage recipient tokens. The security of the sharing connection, including
            identity verification, authentication, and auditing, is managed entirely
            through Delta Sharing and the Databricks platform. It also offers the
            ability to share Databricks notebook files, views, and Unity Catalog volumes.

            Databricks-to-Databricks Delta Sharing is an extension of the Delta Sharing
            feature within Databricks, designed to facilitate easy and secure sharing
            of data between different Databricks workspaces. Databricks, a unified
            data analytics platform, offers an environment for data engineering, data
            science, analytics, and machine learning. One of its core components is
            Delta Lake, an open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions
            to Apache Spark™ and big data workloads.


            Delta Sharing, introduced by Databricks, is the industry’s first open
            protocol for secure, real-time data sharing across organizations regardless
            of which computing platforms they use. It enables organizations to share
            data directly from their Delta Lake with other organizations seamlessly,
            securely, and in real-time, avoiding the complexities and inefficiencies
            of traditional data sharing methods, such as file exchanges or copying
            data into shared databases.


            The concept of Databricks-to-Databricks Delta Sharing simplifies the process
            further for Databricks users. It allows different Databricks workspaces
            to share data with one another directly, leveraging Delta Sharing's secure
            and efficient protocols. This means that data can be shared and accessed
            in real-time between teams, departments, or even separate organizations
            that all utilize Databricks for their data workloads, without having to
            move or copy the data out of the secure Databricks environment.


            Key features of Databricks-to-Databricks Delta Sharing include:


            1. **Data Security and Governance**: It adheres to Databricks’ strong
            security and governance models, ensuring that data is shared in compliance
            with organizational policies and regulations.


            2. **Real-time Sharing**: Data is shared in real-time, enabling immediate
            access to updates and changes, which is crucial for time-sensitive data
            analysis and decision-making.


            3. **Simplified Data Sharing Process**: By allowing direct sharing between
            Databricks workspaces, it eliminates the need for intermediary storage
            solutions or complex data pipelines.


            4. **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces the need for data duplication and storage
            in multiple locations, potentially lowering costs associated with data
            storage and transfer.


            5. **Cross-organizational Collaboration**: Facilitates collaboration between
            different organizations or departments within the same organization, enabling
            a more integrated and efficient approach to data-driven projects and analysis.


            Databricks-to-Databricks Delta Sharing represents a significant step towards
            more integrated, efficient, and secure data ecosystems, particularly for
            organizations that rely heavily on data collaboration and wish to leverage
            the full potential of their data assets in a streamlined manner.

            Databricks-to-Databricks Delta Sharing is a feature that allows for the
            sharing of data between users who have a Databricks workspace enabled
            for Unity Catalog. This form of sharing is designed to facilitate the
            exchange of data across different Databricks accounts, irrespective of
            the cloud service provider, such as AWS, Azure, or GCP. It is particularly
            useful for securely sharing data across different Unity Catalog metastores
            within the same Databricks account or with other accounts.


            An important aspect of Databricks-to-Databricks Delta Sharing is that
            it removes the need for the share recipient to use a token to access the
            shared data, simplifying the process significantly. Similarly, the data
            provider is relieved from the responsibility of managing recipient tokens.
            This is because the security of the sharing connection, including identity
            verification, authentication, and auditing, is fully managed through Delta
            Sharing and the Databricks platform. This integrated approach ensures
            a high level of security and convenience.


            Moreover, Databricks-to-Databricks Delta Sharing is not limited to sharing
            raw data; it also enables the sharing of Databricks notebook files, views,
            and volumes within Unity Catalog. However, it is noteworthy that if you
            are looking to share data between workspaces attached to the same Unity
            Catalog metastore, Delta Sharing is not required, as Unity Catalog itself
            provides functionalities to manage access to data across workspaces efficiently.

            The types of assets that can be included in a Delta Sharing share are
            tables in the Delta or Parquet format, views, Unity Catalog volumes, and
            notebook files. When sharing with a non-Databricks recipient (open sharing),
            tables in the Delta or Parquet format can be included. For Databricks-to-Databricks
            sharing, views, Unity Catalog volumes, and notebook files can also be
            added to a share.

            is not a Databricks user, or does not have access to a Databricks workspace
            that is enabled for Unity Catalog, you must use open sharing. A set of
            token-based credentials is generated for that recipient. If your recipient
            has access to a Databricks workspace that is enabled for Unity Catalog,
            you can use Databricks-to-Databricks sharing, and no token-based credentials

            In a Delta Sharing share, various types of assets can be included. Some
            of the commonly shared assets include:


            1. Tables: Tables are the primary assets that can be shared in Delta Sharing.
            These can be structured data tables containing rows and columns of information.


            2. Databases: Entire databases or specific database tables can be shared
            through Delta Sharing. This allows sharing of multiple related tables
            together.


            3. Files: Delta Sharing also supports sharing of files. These can be any
            type of files such as text files, CSV files, Parquet files, or other file
            formats.


            4. Views: Views created on top of tables or databases can be shared as
            well. Views provide a way to present a customized and filtered version
            of the data to the recipient.


            5. Queries: Instead of sharing the entire dataset, specific queries can
            be shared. Recipients can execute these queries to retrieve the desired
            data from the shared dataset.


            It is important to note that Delta Sharing focuses on sharing data assets
            rather than sharing computational resources or executing complex operations
            on the shared data.

            Delta Sharing allows you to share the following types of assets:


            1. Data Tables: You can share structured data organized in rows and columns,
            similar to a spreadsheet or a relational database.


            2. Data Files: This includes raw data files in various formats such as
            CSV, JSON, Parquet, ORC, and others.


            3. Delta Lake Tables: Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that
            brings reliability to data lakes. Delta Lake tables can be shared using
            Delta Sharing.


            4. Datasets: This can include large and complex data sets, such as those
            used for machine learning or statistical analysis.


            5. Views: A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL
            statement. You can create and share views on your data.


            6. Notebooks: In the context of data analysis, a notebook is a user-friendly
            interface that allows you to write and execute code, and view the results.
            Some platforms allow sharing of these notebooks.


            Please note that the types of assets you can share might depend on the
            specific capabilities of the platform you are using.

            As of my last update in April 2023, Delta Sharing is a protocol designed
            to facilitate the secure sharing of data across organizations. It is primarily
            built on top of Delta Lake, which is an open-source storage layer that
            brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark™ and big data workloads. Given
            this foundation, the types of assets that can be included in a Delta Sharing
            share are primarily data assets stored in Delta Lake. These can include:


            1. **Delta Tables**: This is the most direct asset type, as Delta Sharing
            is designed to share data stored in Delta Lake tables. These tables can
            contain structured data in various formats (such as CSV, JSON, Parquet)
            and are organized in a way that supports efficient data querying and manipulation.


            2. **Views Based on Delta Tables**: While not directly shared as assets
            themselves, views created on top of Delta Tables can be queried by external
            systems, provided the underlying Delta Tables are shared. This allows
            for more complex data products to be constructed and shared, though the
            sharing of the view's definition may need to be managed separately.


            3. **Batch and Streaming Data**: Since Delta Lake supports both batch
            and streaming data workloads, the data shared via Delta Sharing can originate
            from either batch processes or real-time data streams, as long as it is
            stored in a Delta Table.


            4. **Data Across Multiple Clouds and Platforms**: Delta Sharing's design
            allows for data to be shared across different organizations and cloud
            platforms, enabling assets stored in Delta Lake on one cloud to be accessible
            by users or applications on another cloud, subject to access controls
            and permissions.


            Delta Sharing focuses on data interoperability and secure access, rather
            than sharing specific file formats or software artifacts. Therefore, the
            assets are essentially the data contained within the Delta Tables, which
            can be of various types and formats, as long as they are supported by
            the Delta Lake and Apache Spark ecosystems.


            It's important to note that the capabilities and features of Delta Sharing
            and Delta Lake could evolve, so for the most recent details and updates,
            consulting the official documentation and release notes is recommended.

            In a Delta Sharing share, you can include various types of assets depending
            on whether you are sharing data with a Databricks recipient (Databricks-to-Databricks
            sharing) or a non-Databricks recipient (open sharing). Here are the types
            of assets you can share:


            1. **For Databricks-to-Databricks Sharing:**
               - Tables in the Delta or Parquet format.
               - Views.
               - Unity Catalog volumes.
               - Notebook files.

            2. **For Open Sharing (with non-Databricks recipients):**
               - Tables in the Delta or Parquet format only.

            The distinction between the types of sharing is important because it determines
            what assets you can include in your share. Databricks-to-Databricks sharing
            allows for a wider range of asset types to be shared, leveraging the full
            capabilities of the Databricks platform and Unity Catalog. Open sharing,
            on the other hand, is more limited and focuses on sharing tables in popular
            data formats that can be consumed by a variety of data platforms and tools
            outside of the Databricks ecosystem.

            Databricks recommends using Auto Loader for incremental data ingestion.
            Auto Loader automatically detects and processes new files as they arrive
            in cloud object storage. Users or service principals with READ FILES permissions
            on an external location can use Auto Loader to ingest data. Normally,
            data will arrive in an external location due to writes from other systems.

            The recommended method for incremental data ingestion in Databricks is
            to use Delta Lake. Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that provides
            ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and data versioning capabilities
            on top of Apache Spark.


            Delta Lake allows you to efficiently handle change data capture (CDC)
            scenarios by providing a transactional log that tracks changes made to
            the data. This log can be used to perform incremental data ingestion by
            reading only the new or updated records since the last ingestion.


            To perform incremental data ingestion using Delta Lake, you can follow
            these steps:


            1. Initialize a Delta Lake table using the existing data.

            2. Write new or updated data to the Delta Lake table using the `merge`
            operation. The `merge` operation allows you to update existing records
            or insert new records based on a specified condition.

            3. Use the transaction log to identify the changes made to the table since
            the last ingestion. This can be done by reading the transaction log using
            the Delta Lake API.

            4. Process the incremental changes and update downstream systems or perform
            any required transformations.


            By using Delta Lake for incremental data ingestion, you can ensure data
            consistency, reliability, and scalability in your data pipelines. It also
            provides the ability to easily roll back to previous versions of the data
            in case of any issues or errors.

            For incremental data ingestion in Databricks, the recommended method often
            involves using Auto Loader for its simplicity, scalability, and reliability.
            Auto Loader is a structured streaming source built into Databricks that
            simplifies and automates the process of incrementally and efficiently
            ingesting data into Delta Lake.


            Here are the key steps and considerations for using Auto Loader for incremental
            data ingestion in Databricks:


            1. **Identify Data Source**: Your data might be stored in various sources
            such as cloud storage (AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, Google Cloud Storage),
            or Kafka. Ensure that your data source is accessible from your Databricks
            workspace.


            2. **Define Schema or Use Schema Inference**: You can define a schema
            for your data or use Auto Loader’s schema inference capabilities to automatically
            detect the schema of your incoming data files.


            3. **Use CloudFiles**: Auto Loader is built on top of a feature called
            CloudFiles, which provides efficient file listing and notification capabilities.
            When setting up Auto Loader, you specify the source directory and the
            file format. Auto Loader then incrementally processes new files as they
            arrive.


            4. **Set up a Streaming Read with Auto Loader**: Use the Databricks DataFrame
            API to create a streaming DataFrame that reads from your data source using
            Auto Loader. You specify the source format as `cloudFiles`, the location
            of your data, and any other necessary options.

                ```python
                df = spark.readStream.format("cloudFiles") \
                    .option("cloudFiles.format", "json") \
                    .load("/path/to/source/data")
                ```

            5. **Write to Delta Lake**: Use Delta Lake to store your ingested data.
            Delta Lake provides ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and
            unifies streaming and batch data processing. You can write your streaming
            DataFrame to Delta Lake as follows:

                ```python
                df.writeStream.format("delta") \
                    .outputMode("append") \
                    .option("checkpointLocation", "/path/to/checkpoint/dir") \
                    .start("/path/to/delta/table")
                ```

            6. **Handle Updates and Deletes (if needed)**: If your use case involves
            handling updates or deletes to existing records, consider using features
            like Delta Lake's MERGE INTO statement to manage these changes efficiently.


            7. **Optimize for Performance**: Utilize Databricks and Delta Lake optimization
            features like ZORDER, OPTIMIZE, and Auto Compaction to improve query performance
            on the ingested data.


            8. **Monitor and Manage**: Use Databricks’ monitoring features to track
            the performance of your data ingestion pipeline and make adjustments as
            needed.


            Auto Loader’s file notification mode and directory listing mode provide
            flexibility to handle various ingestion scenarios. For most users, the
            simplicity of setting up Auto Loader, combined with the power and reliability
            of Delta Lake, makes it the recommended method for incremental data ingestion
            in Databricks.

            When choosing between Auto Loader and COPY INTO for data ingestion in
            Databricks, there are a few considerations to keep in mind. If you're
            going to ingest files in the order of thousands, you can use COPY INTO.
            However, if you are expecting files in the order of millions or more over
            time, it's recommended to use Auto Loader. Auto Loader requires fewer
            total operations to discover files compared to COPY INTO and can split
            the processing into multiple batches, making it less expensive and more
            efficient at scale. These considerations help in determining the most
            suitable method for data ingestion based on the volume and nature of the
            data being processed.

            When choosing between Auto Loader and COPY INTO for data ingestion in
            Databricks, there are several considerations to keep in mind:


            1. Data source: Auto Loader is specifically designed to ingest streaming
            data from cloud storage sources like Azure Blob Storage or AWS S3. On
            the other hand, COPY INTO is more suitable for batch data ingestion from
            various sources including cloud storage, SFTP, or on-premises locations.


            2. Data volume and velocity: Auto Loader is well-suited for handling high
            volume and high-velocity streaming data, while COPY INTO is more suitable
            for batch data ingestion with a relatively lower volume and velocity.


            3. Data format: Auto Loader supports only certain file formats like Apache
            Parquet, Apache Avro, JSON, CSV, and Delta Lake. COPY INTO, on the other
            hand, supports a wider range of file formats including Parquet, Avro,
            CSV, JSON, ORC, and more.


            4. Data partitioning: Auto Loader automatically partitions the ingested
            data based on the provided partition configuration, making it easier to
            query and analyze. COPY INTO can also partition data, but it requires
            manual configuration.


            5. Cost: Auto Loader has a built-in feature called automatic schema evolution,
            which allows for incremental schema updates without rewriting the entire
            dataset. This can save storage costs. COPY INTO does not have this feature
            and requires rewriting the entire dataset for schema updates.


            6. Ease of use: Auto Loader simplifies the data ingestion process by automatically
            discovering new files in the specified location and ingesting them. COPY
            INTO requires explicit configuration and execution for each ingestion.


            7. Data reliability: Auto Loader provides fault-tolerance and guarantees
            exactly-once semantics for data ingestion, ensuring data integrity. COPY
            INTO does not provide these guarantees.


            Ultimately, the choice between Auto Loader and COPY INTO depends on the
            specific requirements of the data ingestion process, such as the data
            source, volume, velocity, format, partitioning needs, cost considerations,
            and ease of use.

            When choosing between Auto Loader and COPY INTO for data ingestion in
            Databricks, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:


            1. File Volume: If you expect to ingest a large number of files in the
            order of thousands, you can use COPY INTO. On the other hand, if you anticipate
            millions of files or more over time, it is recommended to use Auto Loader.


            2. Scalability: Auto Loader is designed to handle large-scale data ingestion
            efficiently. It requires fewer total operations to discover files compared
            to COPY INTO and can split the processing into multiple batches. This
            makes Auto Loader more cost-effective and efficient at scale.


            3. Data Schema: If your data schema remains consistent across all files,
            both COPY INTO and Auto Loader can be used. However, if you have varying
            schemas within your files, Auto Loader supports schema evolution, allowing
            you to handle schema changes seamlessly.


            4. Cost and Efficiency: As mentioned earlier, Auto Loader is more cost-effective
            and efficient at scale due to its ability to process files in multiple
            batches. It minimizes the number of operations required to discover files,
            resulting in lower costs and faster ingestion.


            In summary, if you have a high volume of files and anticipate scalability
            challenges, Auto Loader is the recommended choice. However, if you have
            a smaller number of files and a consistent data schema, COPY INTO can
            be a suitable option.

            1. **Data Volume and Frequency**: For large volumes of data or continuous
            streaming of data, Auto Loader is a better option as it incrementally
            and efficiently processes new data files as they arrive. COPY INTO is
            more suitable for one-time or infrequent data loads.


            2. **Data Latency**: If you need low-latency data ingestion, Auto Loader
            is a better choice as it allows near real-time data ingestion.


            3. **Complexity of Setup**: Auto Loader requires less complex setup and
            maintenance as compared to COPY INTO. It automatically manages file state
            and can handle schema evolution.


            4. **Reliability**: Auto Loader provides exactly-once processing guarantees
            whereas COPY INTO does not.


            5. **Source Data Location**: Auto Loader supports data ingestion from
            cloud storage like S3 or Azure Blob Storage. COPY INTO can ingest data
            from cloud storage, local file systems, or directly from external databases.


            6. **Cost**: Auto Loader may result in higher costs due to continuous
            monitoring of the source directory and the need for a running Databricks
            cluster. Copy Into can be more cost-effective for infrequent data loads.


            7. **Data Format**: Auto Loader supports various data formats including
            CSV, JSON, Avro, and binary formats. COPY INTO generally supports CSV
            and Parquet formats.


            8. **Schema Evolution**: Auto Loader supports schema evolution, i.e.,
            it can handle changes in the schema of the ingested data over time. This
            is not supported by COPY INTO.


            9. **Data Transformation**: Auto Loader is more suitable for scenarios
            where data needs to be transformed before ingestion. COPY INTO is more
            suitable for scenarios where data can be ingested as-is.


            10. **Performance**: For smaller data sets, COPY INTO can be faster as
            Auto Loader has an initial delay for setting up file state tracking. For
            larger data sets or continuous data streams, Auto Loader can provide better
            performance due to incremental processing.

            When choosing between Auto Loader and COPY INTO for data ingestion in
            Databricks, there are several considerations to keep in mind. Each method
            has its strengths and is suited to different use cases, data sources,
            and requirements. Here's a breakdown of key considerations:


            ### Auto Loader


            **Pros:**

            1. **Simplicity and Scalability:** Auto Loader simplifies the ingestion
            process, making it easy to incrementally and efficiently load data as
            it arrives.

            2. **Schema Evolution:** It supports schema inference and evolution, automatically
            handling changes in the data schema over time.

            3. **Complex File Patterns:** Auto Loader can easily manage complex file
            structures and patterns, making it highly versatile for various data sources.

            4. **Cloud Files Integration:** Designed to seamlessly work with cloud
            storage services (such as AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, Google Cloud
            Storage), enabling efficient data ingestion from these sources.


            **Cons:**

            1. **Cost:** Continuous processing could lead to higher costs, especially
            for small or sporadic workloads.

            2. **Limited to File-based Sources:** Primarily designed for file-based
            data sources; may not be the best choice for streaming or database ingestion
            without additional configuration.


            ### COPY INTO


            **Pros:**

            1. **Performance:** Optimized for loading large volumes of data quickly
            and efficiently, especially from cloud storage.

            2. **Control:** Offers detailed control over the loading process, including
            file pattern matching, error handling, and transactional consistency.

            3. **Cost-Efficient for Bulk Loads:** Ideal for scenarios where data is
            loaded in large batches, as it can be more cost-effective compared to
            continuous processing.


            **Cons:**

            1. **Manual Schema Management:** Requires pre-defined schemas and manual
            adjustments for schema evolution, which could be cumbersome for datasets
            with frequent schema changes.

            2. **Less Flexible:** Lacks the built-in capability to automatically handle
            incremental loads or file patterns as dynamically as Auto Loader.


            ### Key Considerations


            - **Data Source and Format:** If your data is arriving in real-time or
            in small, frequent batches from cloud storage, Auto Loader might be more
            appropriate. For large, periodic bulk loads, COPY INTO could be more efficient.

            - **Schema Evolution:** If you expect your data schema to change over
            time, Auto Loader provides an easier path to manage those changes.

            - **Cost Sensitivity:** For cost-sensitive operations, consider the nature
            of your workloads. Auto Loader may incur higher costs for continuous ingestion,
            while COPY INTO could be more cost-effective for bulk loads.

            - **Operational Simplicity:** Auto Loader offers a simpler, more automated
            approach, reducing the need for manual intervention and complex pipeline
            configurations.

            - **Specific Use Cases:** Evaluate the specific requirements of your project,
            including the need for real-time processing, error handling, and integration
            with other Databricks features.


            Ultimately, the choice between Auto Loader and COPY INTO will depend on
            your specific data ingestion needs, including the nature of the data sources,
            volume and velocity of data, cost considerations, and the need for schema
            management. It's also not uncommon for organizations to use both methods
            across different parts of their data architecture to optimize for efficiency,
            cost, and ease of use.

            \ process large volumes of data and handle schema evolution makes it a\
            \ powerful tool for complex, large-scale data ingestion scenarios.\n\n\
            5. **Use Case and Future Scaling**:\n   - Consider your current and future\
            \ data ingestion needs. If your project is expected to scale significantly\
            \ in terms of data volume, starting with Auto Loader might be the best\

            \ effort and resources later.\n\nIn summary, the choice between Auto Loader\
            \ and COPY INTO in Databricks largely depends on the scale of your data\
            \ ingestion needs, cost and operational efficiency considerations, the\
            \ potential for schema evolution, and the anticipated growth in data volume.\
            \ For large-scale, evolving datasets, Auto Loader is generally the preferred\
            \ choice, while COPY INTO can be effective for smaller, less complex ingestion\
            \ tasks."

            Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring provides the following types of analysis:
            time series, snapshot, and inference. Time series analysis compares data
            distributions across time windows, allowing users to specify the granularities
            over which to calculate metrics. Snapshot analysis monitors how the full
            contents of the table change over time, calculating metrics over all data
            in the table. Inference analysis is used to monitor the performance of
            a machine learning model by attaching the monitor to an inference table
            that holds the model's inputs and corresponding predictions.

            Monitoring expenses. How Lakehouse Monitoring works on Databricks To monitor
            a table in Databricks, you create a monitor attached to the table. To
            monitor the performance of a machine learning model, you attach the monitor
            to an inference table that holds the model’s inputs and corresponding
            predictions. Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring provides the following types
            of analysis: time series, snapshot, and inference. Profile type Description
            Time series Compares data distributions across time windows. You specify
            the granularities over which to calculate metrics (for example, 1 day)
            to compare how your data distribution changes over time. This type of
            profile requires a timestamp column. Snapshot In contrast to time series,
            a snapshot profile monitors how the full contents of the table change
            over time. Metrics are calculated over all data in the table, and monitor
            the table state at each'

            Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring provides three types of analysis:


            1. **Time Series Analysis**: This type compares data distributions across
            different time windows. It requires you to specify the granularity (e.g.,
            1 day) over which to calculate metrics, allowing you to observe how your
            data distribution changes over time. This analysis necessitates a timestamp
            column in the data.


            2. **Snapshot Analysis**: Unlike time series, snapshot analysis focuses
            on monitoring how the full contents of a table change over time. Metrics
            are calculated over all the data in the table to monitor the state of
            the table at each analysis point, providing a "snapshot" of the data's
            state.


            3. **Inference Analysis**: This type is specifically tailored for monitoring
            the performance of machine learning models. You attach the monitor to
            an inference table that contains the models' inputs and their corresponding
            predictions, enabling the analysis of the model's performance over time.

            The purpose of a baseline table in Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring is
            to use it as a reference for measuring drift or the change in values over
            time. It is useful when you have a sample of what you expect your data
            to look like, and drift is then computed relative to expected data values
            and distributions. The baseline table should contain a dataset that serves
            as a reference for measuring changes in the primary table over time.

        - In contrast to time series, a snapshot profile monitors how the full contents
            of the table change over time. Metrics are calculated over all data in
            the table, and monitor the table state at each time the monitor is refreshed.
            Inference A table containing predicted values output by a machine learning
            classification or regression model. This table includes a timestamp, a
            model ID, model inputs (features), a column containing model predictions,
            and optional columns containing unique observation IDs and ground truth
            labels. It may also contain metadata, such as demographic information,
            that is not used as input to the model but might be useful for fairness
            and bias investigations or other monitoring. An inference profile is similar
            to a time series profile but also includes model quality metrics. This
            section briefly describes the input tables used by Databricks Lakehouse
            Monitoring and the metric tables it produces. The diagram shows the relationship
            between the input tables, the metric tables, the monitor, and the dashboard.
            Primary table and baseline table In addition to the table to be monitored,
            called the “primary table”, you can optionally specify a baseline table
            to use as a reference for measuring drift, or the change in values over
            time. A baseline table is useful when you have a sample of what you expect
            your data to look like. The idea is that drift is then computed relative

            In Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring, a baseline table serves multiple crucial
            roles, particularly in the context of performance monitoring, data quality,
            and operational stability. A Databricks Lakehouse, combining the features
            of a data lake and a data warehouse, facilitates the storage and analysis
            of large volumes of data. Monitoring these environments is essential for
            ensuring efficient data processing, reliable analytics, and overall system
            health. Here’s an overview of the purpose of a baseline table within this
            monitoring ecosystem:


            1. **Performance Benchmarking:** One of the primary purposes of a baseline
            table is to serve as a point of reference for system performance. By establishing
            baseline metrics on data processing times, query execution times, and
            other relevant performance indicators, administrators can identify deviations
            from the norm. This is critical for detecting performance degradation
            or the need for optimization.


            2. **Data Quality Control:** Baseline tables can also be used to monitor
            and ensure data quality. By storing expected metrics or data characteristics,
            such as row counts, unique values, null percentages, or patterns in the
            data, it becomes possible to automatically detect anomalies or deviations
            that could indicate data quality issues. This is essential in maintaining
            the integrity and reliability of the data within the lakehouse.


            3. **Trend Analysis and Forecasting:** Analyzing historical data stored
            in baseline tables enables the identification of trends and patterns over
            time. This can be instrumental in forecasting future system behavior,
            resource requirements, or data growth. Understanding these trends is crucial
            for capacity planning and ensuring the scalability of the lakehouse environment.


            4. **Operational Stability:** By continuously monitoring system and data
            metrics against established baselines, organizations can proactively address
            potential issues before they escalate into more significant problems.
            This contributes to the overall stability and reliability of the lakehouse,
            ensuring that data pipelines, analytics, and reporting functions are available
            and performant.


            5. **Change Management:** In dynamic environments where data schemas or
            processing logic might change, baseline tables help in understanding the
            impact of these changes. By comparing pre and post-change metrics, teams
            can assess whether changes have had the intended effect, or if they have
            inadvertently introduced issues.


            6. **Compliance and Auditing:** For organizations subject to regulatory
            requirements, baseline tables can provide a historical record of data
            and system metrics. This can be invaluable for audit trails, compliance
            reporting, and verifying that data has been handled according to policy.


            In summary, baseline tables in Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring play a
            pivotal role in benchmarking, ensuring data quality, analyzing trends,
            maintaining operational stability, managing changes, and supporting compliance
            efforts. They act as a foundation for intelligent, data-driven decision-making
            regarding the health and optimization of the lakehouse environment.

            The purpose of a baseline table in Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring is
            to serve as a reference point for measuring drift, which is the change
            in values or distributions over time in the data being monitored. By comparing
            the current state of the primary table (the table under monitoring) to
            this baseline table, it's possible to identify how significantly the data
            has changed. This comparison helps in understanding whether the data is
            deviating from what is considered normal or expected, based on the dataset
            contained in the baseline table.


            A baseline table is particularly useful because it provides a concrete
            dataset against which changes can be measured. This is essential for tasks
            like ensuring data quality, monitoring the performance of machine learning
            models over time, and identifying potential issues like data drift or
            concept drift. Drift can affect the accuracy of models or the reliability
            of analytics, so having a baseline for comparison helps in taking timely
            actions to correct or adjust the systems relying on the monitored data.


            In summary, the baseline table enables organizations to maintain the integrity
            and reliability of their data and machine learning models by offering
            a means to quantitatively assess changes in their data over time relative
            to a known, expected dataset.

            As of my last update in April 2023, Databricks offers a variety of AI
            and machine learning functions that SQL users can leverage directly within
            their SQL queries. Databricks, known for its Unified Data Analytics Platform,
            integrates various functionalities to support AI and machine learning
            workloads, making it easier for data scientists, engineers, and analysts
            to collaborate and process data at scale. The specific features and capabilities
            may evolve, but here's an overview of the types of AI functions provided
            by Databricks for SQL users:


            1. **Built-in Machine Learning Models**: Databricks SQL allows users to
            apply built-in machine learning models directly within their SQL queries.
            These models can be used for tasks like classification, regression, and
            clustering directly on the data stored in Databricks.


            2. **MLflow Integration**: Databricks tightly integrates with MLflow,
            an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.
            This integration allows SQL users to access MLflow tracking and models
            directly within their SQL environments, facilitating model deployment
            and tracking without leaving the SQL interface.


            3. **Delta Lake for Machine Learning**: With Delta Lake, users can manage
            and version large-scale data for machine learning projects. This is particularly
            useful for SQL users who need to ensure data quality and consistency across
            their machine learning experiments and pipelines.


            4. **Scalable Inference**: Databricks allows for scalable model inference
            directly within SQL queries. This means that SQL users can apply machine
            learning models to large datasets without having to move data out of the
            Databricks environment, ensuring efficient and scalable predictions.


            5. **Spark MLlib Integration**: Since Databricks is built on top of Apache
            Spark, SQL users have access to Spark MLlib, the machine learning library
            within Spark. This integration provides a wide range of machine learning
            algorithms that can be applied directly to data within Databricks using
            SQL syntax.


            6. **Collaborative Notebooks**: While not strictly an AI function, Databricks’
            collaborative notebooks support SQL, Python, Scala, and R, allowing for
            a multi-language approach to data analysis and machine learning. This
            means that SQL users can collaborate with data scientists and engineers
            who prefer to work in other languages, facilitating a more integrated
            approach to developing AI applications.


            7. **Data Visualization and Dashboards**: Databricks SQL analytics provides
            powerful data visualization tools and dashboards. While this is more on
            the analytics side, it supports the exploratory data analysis phase crucial
            in the AI and machine learning workflow, allowing users to quickly identify
            patterns, anomalies, or insights within their data.


            It's important to note that Databricks continues to evolve, and new AI
            functionalities and integrations may have been introduced after my last
            update. For the most current information, I recommend consulting Databricks'
            official documentation or reaching out to their support team.

            Databricks provides AI functions that enable SQL data analysts to directly
            access and utilize large language models (LLMs), including those from
            OpenAI, within their data pipelines and workflows. These AI functions
            are integrated into the Databricks platform, allowing for seamless application
            of advanced AI capabilities without the need for deep machine learning
            expertise or the overhead of managing external AI model deployments.


            While specific function names and detailed usage instructions might evolve,
            the essence of these AI functions is to offer an easy and efficient way
            for SQL users to incorporate generative AI functionalities directly into
            SQL queries and data analysis tasks. This can include tasks such as text
            generation, summarization, translation, and possibly even more sophisticated
            analyses that leverage the natural language understanding capabilities
            of these models.


            To use these functions, a data analyst would typically:


            1. Write SQL queries that incorporate the AI functions provided by Databricks.

            2. Configure the query to specify the desired LLM (e.g., a model from
            OpenAI) and any necessary parameters (e.g., prompt text, maximum response
            length, etc.).

            3. Execute the query within the Databricks environment, which then communicates
            with the specified LLM to generate results.

            4. Use the results directly within their data pipelines and workflows
            for further analysis, reporting, or integration into applications.


            It's important to note that access to these AI functions may require appropriate
            permissions and configurations within the Databricks platform, as well
            as potentially incurring additional costs associated with the use of external
            AI models like those from OpenAI. Users should consult the Databricks
            documentation and pricing information for the most current details on
            available AI functions, usage guidelines, and costs.

            models, data visualization, and more. These notebooks can be based on
            Python, Scala, SQL, or R, and they provide practical examples of how to
            work with specific datasets or perform certain types of analyses.


            3. **Machine Learning Models**: Pre-trained models or model architectures
            that can be adapted to new data. These could include models for image
            recognition, natural language processing, predictive analytics, etc. Sharing
            models allows others to benefit from pre-existing work, saving time and
            resources.


            4. **Dashboards and Visualizations**: Interactive dashboards and visualization
            tools that can be used to explore datasets or to communicate insights
            more effectively. These assets are particularly useful for business users
            and decision-makers who may not be as comfortable working directly with
            raw data.


            5. **APIs and Services**: Some providers may offer access to their APIs
            through the marketplace, allowing users to integrate real-time data feeds
            or analytics services directly into their own applications or workflows.


            6. **Data Pipelines and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Scripts**: Reusable
            data pipeline templates or scripts that help in the extraction, transformation,
            and loading of data from various sources to target systems. These are
            crucial for data engineering tasks and ensure the smooth flow of data
            across systems.


            7. **Analytics and BI (Business Intelligence) Tools**: Pre-built analytics
            solutions or BI tools that can be directly integrated into an organization's
            data stack. These tools can help in deriving insights quickly and efficiently
            without having to build solutions from scratch.

        response_text: >-
            To read binary files using Databricks Runtime, you can use the binary
            file data source. This data source converts each file into a single record
            that contains the raw content and metadata of the file. The produced DataFrame
            includes columns such as `path`, `modificationTime`, `length`, and `content`.
            Additionally, you can specify the data source format as `binaryFile` to
            read binary files. An example of reading binary files is shown below:


            ```python

            # Read binary files


            # Specify the data source format as binaryFile


            # Load binary files


            df = spark.read.format("binaryFile").load("path_to_files")


            # Display the DataFrame


            display(df) # image thumbnails are rendered in the "content" column

            ```
        source:
        - 'Binary file ============= Databricks Runtime supports the binary file data
            source, which reads binary files and converts each file into a single
            record that contains the raw content and metadata of the file. The binary
            file data source produces a DataFrame with the following columns and possibly
            partition columns: * `path (StringType)` : The path of the file. * `modificationTime
            (TimestampType)` : The modification time of the file. In some Hadoop FileSystem
            implementations, this parameter might be unavailable and the value would
            be set to a default value. * `length (LongType)` : The length of the file
            in bytes. * `content (BinaryType)` : The contents of the file. To read
            binary files, specify the data source `format` as `binaryFile` . Images
            -------- Databricks recommends that you use the binary file data source
            to load image data. The Databricks `display` function supports displaying
            image data loaded using the binary data source. If all the loaded files
            have a file name with an image extension , image preview is automatically
            enabled: ```python df = spark.read.format("binaryFile").load("") display(df)
            # image thumbnails are rendered in the "content" column ``` !image preview
            Alternatively, you can force the image preview functionality by using
            the `mimeType` option with a string value `"image/*"` to annotate the
            binary column. Images are decoded based on their format information in
            the binary content. Supported image types are `bmp` , `gif` , `jpeg` ,
            and `png` .'

                    not say clearly about how image files are supposed to be loaded.
                    It should either not mention image thumbnails, or elaborate on
                    how image files are loaded. But this is a minor issue.

            To read binary files using Databricks Runtime, you can use the `spark.read`
            API with the `binaryFiles` method. Here's an example:


            ```python

            # Import the necessary libraries

            from pyspark.sql import SparkSession


            # Create a SparkSession

            spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()


            # Read binary files from a directory

            binary_files = spark.read.binaryFiles("/path/to/binary/files")


            # Display the content of binary files

            binary_files.show()

            ```


            In the above example, `/path/to/binary/files` should be replaced with
            the actual path to your binary files directory. The `binaryFiles` method
            reads the binary files as a binary stream and returns a DataFrame with
            two columns: `path` (the file path) and `content` (the binary content
            of the file).


            You can further process the binary files DataFrame as per your requirements
            using Spark DataFrame operations.

            ```


            In the above code, replace `/path/to/binary/files` with the actual path
            to your binary files. This will load the binary files and create a DataFrame
            with the columns `path`, `modificationTime`, `length`, and `content`.


            To display image data loaded using the binary data source, you can use
            the `display` function:


            ```

            display(df)

            ```


            If all the loaded files have a file name with an image extension, image

            Reading binary files in Databricks runtime can be accomplished using the
            spark.read.format("binaryFile") function. Here's an example:


            ```python

            # Define the path to the binary file

            path = "/path/to/binary/files"


            # Read the binary file

            df = spark.read.format("binaryFile").load(path)


            # Display the DataFrame

            display(df)

            ```


            The resulting DataFrame will have the following columns:


            - `path`: StringType - The file path.

            - `modificationTime`: TimestampType - The modification time of the file.

            - `length`: LongType - The length of the file in bytes.

            - `content`: BinaryType - The content of the file.


            Please note that binary file format is available since Spark 2.3 and in
            Databricks Runtime 4.0 and above.

            To read binary files using Databricks Runtime, you typically leverage
            the `spark.read.format()` function with the format set to "binaryFile".
            This allows you to read binary files stored in a distributed file system
            accessible by your Databricks cluster, such as AWS S3, Azure Data Lake
            Storage, Google Cloud Storage, or HDFS. The binary files could be images,
            PDFs, proprietary data formats, or any file that is not in a text-readable
            format.


            Here's how to read binary files using Databricks Runtime:


            ### Step 1: Access your Databricks workspace


            First, ensure you have access to your Databricks workspace and the necessary
            permissions to read data from the storage locations where your binary
            files are stored.


            ### Step 2: Create a new notebook


            Create a new notebook in your Databricks workspace. You can choose Python,
            Scala, R, or SQL to work with, but the examples below will use Python.


            ### Step 3: Read the binary files


            Use the `spark.read.format("binaryFile")` function to load your binary
            files into a DataFrame. You need to specify the path to the files you
            want to read. You can also use options like `pathGlobFilter` to select
            specific types of files and `recursiveFileLookup` to search for files
            in subdirectories.


            #### Python Example:


            ```python

            # Read binary files from a specified path

            df = spark.read.format("binaryFile") \
                .option("pathGlobFilter", "*.pdf") \  # Example for PDF files, adjust
            the extension as needed
                .option("recursiveFileLookup", "true") \
                .load("/path/to/your/binary/files")

            df.show()

            ```


            This code snippet will read all PDF files from the specified directory
            (and its subdirectories, if any) into a DataFrame. The resulting DataFrame
            will have columns like `path`, `modificationTime`, `length`, and `content`,
            where `content` is a binary column containing the file's raw content.


            ### Step 4: Work with the data


            Once you have the binary data loaded into a DataFrame, you can perform
            various operations on it, depending on your requirements. For instance,
            you might want to apply a machine learning model to the data, or you might
            need to extract text from PDF files using a library that can be called
            from your Databricks notebook.


            ### Note:


            - Ensure the path you specify in `.load("/path/to/your/binary/files")`
            is accessible from your Databricks environment and that you have the necessary
            permissions.

            - Handling binary data often requires significant memory, especially if
            the files are large. Monitor your cluster's performance and adjust its
            size as needed.

            - For proprietary or uncommon binary formats, you may need to use or develop
            custom parsers to process the data after loading it.


            This guide provides a basic overview of reading binary files using Databricks
            Runtime. Depending on your specific use case, you might need to explore
            additional options or perform more complex data processing.

            To read binary files using Databricks Runtime, follow these steps to utilize
            the binary file data source, which is specifically designed to read binary
            files and convert each file into a single record that consists of the
            file's raw content along with its metadata. Here's how to do it:


            1. **Specify the Data Source Format**: Start by specifying `binaryFile`
            as the data source format. This tells Spark that you're working with binary
            files and it should use the appropriate handler to process these files.


            2. **Load the Files**: Use the `load()` method to specify the path to
            your binary files. This path can be a single file, a directory containing
            multiple files, or even a pattern that matches multiple files.


            3. **Accessing the DataFrame**: The operation returns a DataFrame with
            each binary file represented as a row. This DataFrame includes the following
            columns by default:
               - `path` (StringType): The path of the file.
               - `modificationTime` (TimestampType): The modification time of the
            file. Note that in some file systems, this value might not be available
            and could be set to a default value.
               - `length` (LongType): The length of the file in bytes.
               - `content` (BinaryType): The raw contents of the file.

            Here is a simple example in Python to illustrate these steps:


            ```python

            # Example: Reading binary files in Databricks Runtime

            df = spark.read.format("binaryFile").load("/path/to/your/binary/files")


            # To display the DataFrame and inspect the information

            df.show(truncate=False)

            ```


            In this example, replace `"/path/to/your/binary/files"` with the actual
            path to your binary files. This can be a path on a distributed file system
            that Databricks Runtime has access to.


            ### Displaying Image Data


            If you're specifically working with image data, Databricks Runtime offers
            additional support:


            - **Image Preview**: If the files have recognized image extensions (like
            `.jpg`, `.png`, etc.), Databricks automatically enables image preview
            in the notebook when you display the DataFrame.


            - **Forcing Image Preview**: If you want to force image preview for binary
            data that is known to be images but might not have recognized extensions,
            you can use the `mimeType` option with the value `"image/*"`:


            ```python

            df = spark.read.format("binaryFile").option("mimeType", "image/*").load("/path/to/your/images")

            display(df)

            ```


            This will render thumbnails of the images in the "content" column of the
            DataFrame when displayed in a Databricks notebook.


            By following these steps, you can efficiently read binary files, including
            images, using Databricks Runtime and process them further according to
            your analytical or data processing needs.

            To schedule a query execution in Azure Databricks, you can use scheduled
            query executions to update your dashboards or enable routine alerts. By
            default, queries do not have a schedule. To set the schedule, you can
            go to the Query Editor, click **Schedule** > **Add schedule** to open
            a menu with schedule settings. Then, choose when to run the query by specifying
            the frequency, period, starting time, and time zone using the dropdown
            pickers. Additionally, you can select **More options** to show optional
            settings such as a name for the schedule and a SQL warehouse to power
            the query. Finally, click **Create** and the query will run automatically
            according to the schedule.

            \ executing Python scripts, or running JARs. Here's how you can schedule\
            \ a query execution:\n\n### Step 1: Create a Notebook for Your Query\n\
            1. **Create a new notebook** in Databricks where you will write your query.\
            \ You can do this by navigating to the Workspace, clicking on “Create”\
            \ and selecting “Notebook.”\n2. Choose the **appropriate language** for\
            \ your notebook (e.g., Python, Scala, SQL) based on your query.\n3. **Write\
            \ your query** in the notebook. You can test it to make sure it works\
            \ as expected.\n\n### Step 2: Create a Job\n1. Go to the **Jobs** page\
            \ in your Databricks workspace. You can find this in the sidebar.\n2.\
            \ Click on **Create Job**. You will be prompted to configure your job.\n\
            3. **Name your job** for easy identification.\n4. In the **Tasks** section,\
            \ click on “Add Task.” Here, you will select the notebook you created\
            \ in Step 1. This tells Databricks which notebook to run as part of the\
            \ job.\n   - **Task Name**: Give a name to your task.\n   - **Type**:\
            \ Select “Notebook.”\n   - **Path**: Choose the notebook you created earlier.\n\
            \   - Optionally, you can add **Parameters** if your notebook requires\
            \ them.\n5. Configure the **Cluster** options. You can either select an\
            \ existing cluster or configure a new one. The cluster is where your query\
            \ will be executed.\n\n### Step 3: Schedule the Job\n1. In the job configuration\
            \ page, go to the **Schedule** section.\n2. Enable the **Scheduled** toggle.\n\
            3. Set the **Cron Schedule**. Azure Databricks uses Unix-cron syntax for\
            \ scheduling. For example, `0 0 * * *` would run the job at midnight UTC\
            \ every day.\n   - You can also use the UI to configure common schedules\
            \ without needing to know cron syntax.\n4. Configure any **Alerts** if\
            \ you want to be notified when the job succeeds or fails.\n5. Click on\
            \ **Create** or **Save** to finalize the job.\n\n### Step 4: Monitor Your\
            \ Job\n- Once your job is scheduled, it will run according to the schedule\
            \ you set. \n- You can monitor its execution and view logs by going to\
            \ the Jobs page and clicking on your job. Here, you will see past runs,\
            \ their status, and detailed execution logs.\n\n### Notes:\n- Ensure your\
            \ cluster has enough resources to handle the query execution, especially\
            \ if it’s resource-intensive or you're running multiple jobs.\n- Consider\
            \ the cost implications of running scheduled jobs, particularly if you're\
            \ using a new cluster for each job execution.\n- The exact UI elements\
            \ and steps may vary slightly depending on the Databricks version or updates\
            \ to the platform.\n\nThis process should help you schedule and automate\
            \ query executions in Azure Databricks, making it easier to manage periodic\
            \ data processing tasks."

            Scheduling a query execution in Azure Databricks can be done by setting
            up a scheduled job within the Databricks environment. Here's a step-by-step
            guide to schedule a query execution:


            1. **Open the Query Editor**: Start by navigating to the Query Editor
            within Azure Databricks.


            2. **Schedule the Query**:
               - Click on **Schedule** and then select **Add schedule** to open the
            scheduling menu.
               - In this menu, you can configure when and how often the query should
            run. Use the dropdown menus to choose the frequency (e.g., daily, weekly),
            the specific period (e.g., every day, every Monday), the starting time
            for the execution, and the desired time zone.
               - For more advanced scheduling, you can select the **Show cron syntax**
            checkbox. This option allows you to define the schedule using Quartz Cron
            Syntax, offering a higher level of customization.
               - If you want to access additional settings, click on **More options**.
            Here you can:
                 - Assign a name to your schedule for easier identification.
                 - Select a SQL warehouse to power the query. By default, the query
            will use the same SQL warehouse as ad hoc queries, but you can choose
            a different warehouse if needed.

            3. **Create the Schedule**:
               - Once you've configured all settings, click **Create** to finalize
            the schedule. Your query will now automatically run according to the schedule
            you've set.

            **Note**: It's important to remember that if the query is tied to an alert,
            the alert will operate on its own refresh schedule, independent of the
            query schedule.


            If a scheduled query fails to execute as planned, you should manually
            trigger the query to ensure it works correctly. Azure Databricks employs
            a back-off algorithm for retrying failed scheduled query executions, meaning
            retries become less frequent if failures persist. This can result in the
            next retry being delayed beyond the originally scheduled interval.


            By following these steps, you should be able to effectively schedule query
            executions in Azure Databricks, allowing for regular updates to dashboards
            or routine alerts without manual intervention.

            Contributor role provides full access to the workspace, while the Reader
            role has read-only access.

            5. In the "Add members" section, enter the email address or the Azure
            Active Directory (AAD) user or group name of the user you want to add.
            You can also select users from the directory by clicking on the "Select"
            button.

            6. Click on the "Save" button to add the user to the Azure Databricks
            workspace.


            Once the user is added, they will receive an email invitation to join
            the workspace. They can accept the invitation and sign in using their
            Azure AD credentials.

            Adding a user to an Azure Databricks workspace is a straightforward process,
            but it requires you to have the necessary permissions, typically as an
            admin. Here's how you can do it:


            ### Step 1: Access Azure Databricks Workspace

            First, log in to your Azure Portal:


            1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

            2. Navigate to the Databricks service by searching for "Databricks" in
            the search bar or finding it under your services.

            3. Click on the Databricks workspace where you want to add the user.


            ### Step 2: Launch Workspace

            Within the Azure Databricks service pane:


            1. Click on the "Launch Workspace" button. This action will open the Databricks
            workspace in a new tab or window.


            ### Step 3: Open Admin Console

            Once inside the Databricks workspace:


            1. Look for the "Admin Console" which can typically be found under the
            user profile at the bottom left corner or through the settings/options
            menu. It might vary slightly based on the Databricks UI updates.

            2. Click on "Admin Console" or the equivalent based on your UI.


            ### Step 4: Add a User

            In the Admin Console:


            1. Navigate to the "Users" tab.

            2. You will see an option to add a user, typically labeled as "Add User",
            "Create User", or a "+" icon.

            3. Click on it, and a form will appear.


            ### Step 5: Fill in User Details

            In the form for adding a new user:


            1. Enter the email address of the user you wish to add. This is typically
            their Azure Active Directory (AAD) email if your organization uses AAD
            for authentication.

            2. Assign the appropriate role to the user. Roles could be Admin, User,
            or any custom roles defined in your workspace.

            3. Optionally, you can add the user to specific groups within your Databricks
            workspace at this stage if you have predefined groups.

            4. Click “Add” or “Save” to finalize adding the user.


            ### Step 6: Notify the User

            After adding the user:


            1. They will typically receive an email invitation to join the Azure Databricks
            workspace.

            2. Inform the user to check their email (including spam or junk folders)
            for the invitation.

            3. They might need to follow the link in the invitation email and sign
            in with their credentials to access the workspace.


            ### Step 7: Verify Access

            Ensure the user can access the workspace:


            1. It's good practice to confirm with the user that they've received the
            invitation and can access the workspace as expected.

            2. You might also want to verify their permissions and access level by
            either asking them to check or by viewing their user profile in the Admin
            Console.


            ### Troubleshooting

            - If the user doesn’t receive the email, check the email address entered
            for any mistakes and resend the invitation.

            - Ensure the user is using the correct email and password associated with
            their Azure Active Directory account if applicable.

            - If there are issues with permissions, review the roles and group memberships
            assigned to the user.


            Remember, these steps can slightly vary as Azure Databricks and Azure
            Portal are updated over time, so always refer to the latest Azure Databricks
            documentation for the most current information.

            To add a user to an Azure Databricks workspace, follow these steps:


            1. **Go to the admin settings page**: Access your Azure Databricks workspace,
            and navigate to the admin settings area where you can manage users and
            groups.


            2. **Click on the "Identity and access" tab**: Within the admin settings,
            find and click on the "Identity and access" tab to manage workspace access.


            3. **Next to "Users", click "Manage"**: Here, you'll see the option to
            manage users. Click on "Manage" to proceed with adding a new user.


            4. **Click "Add User"**: You'll find an option to add a new user to the
            workspace. Click on this to proceed.


            5. **Enter the user email ID**: In the provided field, enter the email
            ID of the user you want to add. This must be an email ID associated with
            a user in the Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) tenant
            of your Azure Databricks workspace. For example, if you're adding a user
            with the email `user@example.com`, you would enter this email address
            here.


            6. **Click "OK"**: After entering the email ID, click "OK" to add the
            user to the workspace.


            7. **Click the "Databricks SQL access" checkbox**: Before confirming the
            addition, make sure to enable SQL access for the new user by clicking
            the checkbox labeled "Databricks SQL access". This is crucial for the
            user to be able to run SQL queries within the Databricks environment.


            8. **Click "Confirm"**: Finally, confirm the addition of the new user
            by clicking the "Confirm" button. This will complete the process, and
            the user will now have access to the Azure Databricks workspace.


            Remember, adding a user requires that you are an Azure Databricks workspace
            admin, ensuring you have the necessary permissions to manage users and
            their access.

            To create a visualization in Databricks SQL using a SQL query, you can
            follow these steps:


            1. Open the Databricks SQL interface and navigate to the notebook or workspace
            where you want to create the visualization.


            2. Write a SQL query that retrieves the data you want to visualize. Make
            sure the query returns the necessary columns for your visualization.


            3. Execute the SQL query by running the cell or code block containing
            the query.


            4. Once the query has executed and returned the results, click on the
            "Chart" button located above the query results.


            5. Select the appropriate chart type from the available options, such
            as bar chart, line chart, pie chart, etc.


            6. Customize the visualization by selecting the desired columns for the
            x-axis, y-axis, labels, legends, and any other relevant options.


            7. Click on the "Apply" or "Create" button to generate the visualization.


            8. The visualization will be displayed below the query results in the
            notebook or workspace. You can interact with it, zoom in/out, and download
            it if needed.


            Note: Databricks SQL also provides additional features and functionalities
            for advanced visualizations, such as using Python libraries like Matplotlib
            or Seaborn. These may require additional setup and code integration.

        response_text: "Creating a visualization in Databricks SQL using a SQL query\
            \ involves several steps. Databricks allows you to analyze and visualize\
            \ data directly from your SQL queries, making it a powerful tool for generating\
            \ insights. Below is a step-by-step guide to creating a visualization\
            \ based on a SQL query in Databricks:\n\n1. **Open Databricks SQL Environment**:\n\
            \   - Start by navigating to your Databricks workspace. Ensure you have\
            \ the necessary permissions to access the Databricks SQL (formerly known\
            \ as SQL Analytics) environment.\n\n2. **Create or Choose a SQL Query**:\n\
            \   - If you haven’t already written a SQL query, you can create a new\
            \ query by selecting the \"SQL Editor\" or similar option, depending on\
            \ the version of Databricks you are using. Otherwise, locate a pre-existing\
            \ query you wish to visualize.\n\n3. **Write or Execute Your SQL Query**:\n\
            \   - In the SQL editor, write or paste your SQL query. Execute the query\
            \ to ensure it runs correctly and returns the expected results. This query\
            \ will form the basis of your visualization.\n\n4. **Create a Visualization**:\n\
            \   - Once your query runs successfully and you can see the results, look\
            \ for an option to create a visualization. This is usually represented\
            \ by a chart icon or a button labeled \"Visualize\" in the results section\
            \ or toolbar.\n   \n5. **Choose Visualization Type**:\n   - After clicking\
            \ on the option to create a visualization, you will be presented with\
            \ a variety of chart types (e.g., bar, line, pie, scatter, etc.). Select\
            \ the type that best suits the data you want to represent. The choice\
            \ of visualization depends on what you want to convey. For instance, time\
            \ series data is often best represented as a line chart, whereas categorical\
            \ data comparisons can be effectively shown in a bar chart.\n\n6. **Configure\
            \ Visualization Settings**:\n   - Configure the visualization by mapping\
            \ the columns from your query results to the axes or dimensions of the\
            \ chart. For example, you might drag a date column to the X-axis and a\
            \ sales column to the Y-axis.\n   - Adjust additional settings as necessary,\
            \ such as adding filters, changing the chart's appearance, or modifying\
            \ labels and titles to make the visualization clearer.\n\n7. **Save and\
            \ Share the Visualization**:\n   - Once you're satisfied with the visualization,\
            \ save it. Databricks allows you to add visualizations to dashboards or\
            \ share them directly with your team or stakeholders. Look for a save\
            \ or share option within the visualization interface.\n\n8. **Refine and\
            \ Iterate**:\n   - You might need to go back and adjust the SQL query\
            \ or edit the visualization settings based on feedback or as you refine\
            \ your analysis. Databricks makes it easy to iterate on your work.\n\n\
            Keep in mind that the exact steps and interface elements might vary slightly\
            \ depending on the version of Databricks you're using and the specific\
            \ configurations of your Databricks workspace. Always refer to the latest\
            \ Databricks documentation for the most accurate and detailed instructions."

            \ configuring the visualization will appear. Here, you can select the\
            \ type of visualization (e.g., Bar, Line, Pie, etc.) from the **Visualization\
            \ Type** drop-down menu. For this example, you might choose **Bar**.\n\
            \    - **Name Your Visualization**: Provide a name for your visualization,\
            \ such as \"Dropoff Rates\".\n    - **Review and Adjust Properties**:\
            \ Take a moment to review and adjust any other properties or settings\

            \ or colors, depending on the type of visualization you're creating and\
            \ the data it's based on.\n\n5. **Save Visualization**: After configuring\
            \ the visualization to your liking, click **Save** to preserve it. \n\n\
            6. **View and Interact with Your Visualization**: Once saved, your visualization\
            \ will be displayed. You can interact with it using the Plotly toolbar\

        response_text: >-
            To implement a UserDefinedAggregateFunction in Scala for Apache Spark
            SQL, you can create a class that extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction.
            This class should override inputSchema, bufferSchema, dataType, deterministic,
            initialize, and update methods. The inputSchema method defines the input
            fields for the aggregate function, while the bufferSchema method defines
            the internal fields for computing the aggregate. The dataType method specifies
            the output type of the aggregation function, and the deterministic method
            indicates whether the function is deterministic. The initialize method
            sets the initial value for the buffer schema, and the update method updates
            the buffer schema given an input.

            To implement a UserDefinedAggregateFunction (UDAF) in Scala for Apache
            Spark SQL, you need to follow these steps:


            1. Import the necessary Spark SQL classes:

            ```scala

            import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.{MutableAggregationBuffer, UserDefinedAggregateFunction}

            import org.apache.spark.sql.types._

            ```


            2. Extend the UserDefinedAggregateFunction class and override its methods:

            ```scala

            class MyUDAF extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction {

              // Define the input schema for the UDAF
              def inputSchema: StructType = StructType(StructField("input", DoubleType)
            :: Nil)

              // Define the buffer schema for intermediate values
              def bufferSchema: StructType = StructType(StructField("sum", DoubleType)
            :: StructField("count", LongType) :: Nil)

              // Define the output schema of the UDAF
              def dataType: DataType = DoubleType

              // Define whether the UDAF is deterministic or not
              def deterministic: Boolean = true

              // Initialize the buffer values
              def initialize(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer): Unit = {
                buffer(0) = 0.0 // sum
                buffer(1) = 0L  // count
              }

              // Update the buffer values with each input
              def update(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer, input: Row): Unit = {
                if (!input.isNullAt(0)) {
                  buffer(0) = buffer.getDouble(0) + input.getDouble(0) // sum
                  buffer(1) = buffer.getLong(1) + 1L                    // count
                }
              }

              // Merge intermediate buffer values
              def merge(buffer1: MutableAggregationBuffer, buffer2: Row): Unit = {
                buffer1(0) = buffer1.getDouble(0) + buffer2.getDouble(0) // sum
                buffer1(1) = buffer1.getLong(1) + buffer2.getLong(1)     // count
              }

              // Calculate the final result
              def evaluate(buffer: Row): Any = {
                buffer.getDouble(0) / buffer.getLong(1) // average
              }
            }

            ```


            3. Register the UDAF with Spark SQL:

            ```scala

            val myUDAF = new MyUDAF()

            spark.udf.register("my_udaf", myUDAF)

            ```


            4. Use the UDAF in your Spark SQL queries:

            ```scala

            val df = spark.range(1, 100).toDF("value")

            df.createOrReplaceTempView("my_table")

            spark.sql("SELECT my_udaf(value) FROM my_table").show()

            ```


            In the above example, the UDAF calculates the average of a column named
            "value" in the "my_table" DataFrame. You can modify the UDAF implementation
            to perform different aggregations based on your requirements.

                reason: This is actually a pretty good answer even thought no context
                    is provided. However, one drawback is that to use the UDAF, you
                    need to call `select group_id, my_udaf(value) from my_table group
                    by group_id`, where the important part is to call "group by" since
                    it's an "aggregated function". The answer calls it as a regular
                    UDF, which is not correct. But this is a minor issue since the
                    question is about how to implement a UDAF, not focusing on how
                    to use it.

            To implement a `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` in Scala for Apache Spark
            SQL, you need to extend the `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` class and override
            its methods. Here's an example:


            ```scala

            import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.MutableAggregationBuffer

            import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.UserDefinedAggregateFunction

            import org.apache.spark.sql.Row

            import org.apache.spark.sql.types._


            class GeometricMean extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction {
              // This is the input fields for your aggregate function.
              override def inputSchema: org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType =
                StructType(StructField("value", DoubleType) :: Nil)

              // This is the internal fields you keep for computing your aggregate.
              override def bufferSchema: StructType = StructType(
                StructField("count", LongType) ::
                StructField("product", DoubleType) :: Nil
              )

              // This is the output type of your aggregation function.
              override def dataType: DataType = DoubleType

              override def deterministic: Boolean = true

              // This is the initial value for your buffer schema.
              override def initialize(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer): Unit = {
                buffer(0) = 0L // count
                buffer(1) = 1.0 // product
              }

              // This is how to update your buffer schema given an input.
              override def update(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer, input: Row): Unit
            = {
                buffer(0) = buffer.getAs[Long](0) + 1
                buffer(1) = buffer.getAs[Double](1) * input.getAs[Double](0)
              }

              // This is how to merge two objects with the bufferSchema type.
              override def merge(buffer1: MutableAggregationBuffer, buffer2: Row):
            Unit = {
                buffer1(0) = buffer1.getAs[Long](0) + buffer2.getAs[Long](0)
                buffer1(1) = buffer1.getAs[Double](1) * buffer2.getAs[Double](1)
              }

              // This is where you output the final value, given the final value of
            your bufferSchema.
              override def evaluate(buffer: Row): Any = {
                math.pow(buffer.getDouble(1), 1.toDouble / buffer.getLong(0))
              }
            }

            ```


            In this example, we create a `GeometricMean` class that extends `UserDefinedAggregateFunction`.
            We override several methods to define the input schema, buffer schema,
            data type, and behavior of the aggregation function.


            To use this `UserDefinedAggregateFunction`, you need to register it with
            Spark SQL. Here's an example of how to register and use it:


            ```scala

            import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession

            import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._


            val spark = SparkSession.builder()
              .appName("UDAFExample")
              .master("local")
              .getOrCreate()

            // Register the UDAF

            val geometricMean = new GeometricMean()

            spark.udf.register("geometric_mean", geometricMean)


            // Use the UDAF in a SQL query

            val df = spark.range(1, 10).toDF("value")

            df.createOrReplaceTempView("myTable")


            spark.sql("SELECT geometric_mean(value) AS result FROM myTable").show()

            ```


            In this example, we register the `GeometricMean` UDAF as a function named
            "geometric_mean" using `spark.udf.register()`. Then, we can use the UDAF
            in a SQL query by calling the registered function.

            \ with an existing codebase or have specific reasons for using `UserDefinedAggregateFunction`,\
            \ here's how you can implement it:\n\n### Step 1: Define Your UDAF\n\n\
            The first step is to extend the `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` class and\
            \ implement its methods. Here's an example UDAF that calculates the average:\n\
            \n```scala\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.{Encoder, Encoders}\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.Aggregator\n\
            import org.apache.spark.sql.Row\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.MutableAggregationBuffer\n\
            import org.apache.spark.sql.types.{DataType, DoubleType, StructField,\
            \ StructType}\n\nclass AverageUDAF extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction\
            \ {\n  // Define the input schema of your aggregate function\n  def inputSchema:\
            \ StructType = StructType(StructField(\"inputColumn\", DoubleType) ::\
            \ Nil)\n  \n  // Intermediate schema during aggregation\n  def bufferSchema:\
            \ StructType = {\n    StructType(StructField(\"sum\", DoubleType) :: StructField(\"\
            count\", DoubleType) :: Nil)\n  }\n  \n  // Return type of your aggregation\
            \ function\n  def dataType: DataType = DoubleType\n  \n  // Whether this\
            \ function always returns the same output on the identical input\n  def\
            \ deterministic: Boolean = true\n  \n  // Initializes the given aggregation\
            \ buffer\n  def initialize(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer): Unit = {\n\
            \    buffer(0) = 0D // sum\n    buffer(1) = 0D // count\n  }\n  \n  //\
            \ Updates the given aggregation buffer `buffer` with new input data from\
            \ `input`\n  def update(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer, input: Row):\
            \ Unit = {\n    if (!input.isNullAt(0)) {\n      buffer(0) = buffer.getDouble(0)\
            \ + input.getDouble(0)\n      buffer(1) = buffer.getDouble(1) + 1\n  \
            \  }\n  }\n  \n  // Merges two aggregation buffers and stores the updated\
            \ buffer values back to `buffer1`\n  def merge(buffer1: MutableAggregationBuffer,\
            \ buffer2: Row): Unit = {\n    buffer1(0) = buffer1.getDouble(0) + buffer2.getDouble(0)\n\
            \    buffer1(1) = buffer1.getDouble(1) + buffer2.getDouble(1)\n  }\n \
            \ \n  // Calculates the final result\n  def evaluate(buffer: Row): Any\
            \ = buffer.getDouble(0) / buffer.getDouble(1)\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Register\
            \ and Use Your UDAF in Spark SQL\n\nOnce you've defined your UDAF, you\
            \ can register and use it with Spark SQL as follows:\n\n```scala\nimport\
            \ org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession\n\nval spark = SparkSession.builder()\n\
            \  .appName(\"UDAF Example\")\n  .master(\"local\")\n  .getOrCreate()\n\
            \n// Register the UDAF\nspark.udf.register(\"averageUDAF\", new AverageUDAF())\n\
            \n// Assuming you have a DataFrame `df` with a column \"value\" you want\
            \ to average\ndf.createOrReplaceTempView(\"table\")\n\n// Use the UDAF\
            \ in SQL\nval result = spark.sql(\"SELECT averageUDAF(value) AS average\
            \ FROM table\")\n\nresult.show()\n```\n\n### Considerations\n\nAlthough\
            \ the example above demonstrates how to implement and use a `UserDefinedAggregateFunction`,\
            \ for new development, it's generally recommended to use the `Aggregator`\
            \ API due to its type safety and ease of use with the Dataset API. The\
            \ `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` API works with `Row` objects and requires\
            \ manual schema definition, which can be error-prone and less efficient.\n\
            \nThis guide should provide a good starting point for implementing UDAFs\
            \ in Scala for Apache Spark SQL, though adapting it to your specific needs\
            \ may require additional customization."

        response_text: "Implementing a UserDefinedAggregateFunction (UDAF) in Scala\
            \ for Apache Spark SQL involves several steps. The UDAF will allow you\
            \ to define custom aggregation operations that can be used in your Spark\
            \ SQL queries. Below is a step-by-step guide to implementing a UDAF, illustrated\
            \ with an example of a Geometric Mean calculation.\n\n### Step 1: Define\
            \ Your UDAF Class\n\nYour UDAF class should extend `UserDefinedAggregateFunction`.\
            \ This abstract class requires you to implement several methods that define\
            \ the characteristics and behavior of your custom aggregation function.\n\
            \n### Step 2: Implement Required Methods\n\n1. **inputSchema**: Specifies\
            \ the schema of the input data to your aggregation function. This is what\
            \ your function expects from the DataFrame.\n   \n2. **bufferSchema**:\
            \ Defines the schema of the intermediate data your function needs to keep\
            \ track of during aggregation.\n   \n3. **dataType**: Specifies the DataType\
            \ of the result of the aggregation.\n   \n4. **deterministic**: Indicates\
            \ whether your function always produces the same result for a given input.\n\
            \   \n5. **initialize**: Initializes the buffer schema with initial values.\n\
            \   \n6. **update**: Updates the buffer with an input row. This is where\
            \ you put your aggregation logic for each input row.\n   \n7. **merge**:\
            \ Combines two aggregation buffers and stores the updated buffer values.\
            \ This method is crucial for distributed computing where data is split\
            \ across different nodes.\n   \n8. **evaluate**: Transforms the aggregation\
            \ buffer into the final result. This is what gets returned after all rows\
            \ have been aggregated.\n\n### Example: Geometric Mean UDAF\n\n```scala\n\
            import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.MutableAggregationBuffer\nimport\
            \ org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.UserDefinedAggregateFunction\nimport\
            \ org.apache.spark.sql.Row\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\n\nclass\
            \ GeometricMean extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction {\n  // Input fields\
            \ for your aggregate function.\n  override def inputSchema: StructType\
            \ = StructType(StructField(\"value\", DoubleType) :: Nil)\n  \n  // Internal\
            \ fields for computing your aggregate.\n  override def bufferSchema: StructType\
            \ = StructType(\n    StructField(\"count\", LongType) :: StructField(\"\
            product\", DoubleType) :: Nil)\n  \n  // Output type of your aggregation\
            \ function.\n  override def dataType: DataType = DoubleType\n  \n  override\
            \ def deterministic: Boolean = true\n  \n  // Initialize your buffer schema.\n\
            \  override def initialize(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer): Unit = {\n\
            \    buffer(0) = 0L // count\n    buffer(1) = 1.0 // product\n  }\n  \n\
            \  // Update your buffer given an input.\n  override def update(buffer:\
            \ MutableAggregationBuffer, input: Row): Unit = {\n    if (!input.isNullAt(0))\
            \ {\n      buffer(0) = buffer.getAs[Long](0) + 1\n      buffer(1) = buffer.getAs[Double](1)\
            \ * input.getAs[Double](0)\n    }\n  }\n  \n  // Merge two intermediate\
            \ buffers.\n  override def merge(buffer1: MutableAggregationBuffer, buffer2:\
            \ Row): Unit = {\n    buffer1(0) = buffer1.getAs[Long](0) + buffer2.getAs[Long](0)\n\
            \    buffer1(1) = buffer1.getAs[Double](1) * buffer2.getAs[Double](1)\n\
            \  }\n  \n  // Calculate the final result.\n  override def evaluate(buffer:\
            \ Row): Any = {\n    math.pow(buffer.getAs[Double](1), 1.toDouble / buffer.getAs[Long](0))\n\
            \  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Register and Use the UDAF\n\nAfter implementing\
            \ your UDAF, you need to register it with Spark SQL to use it in your\
            \ queries.\n\n```scala\nval spark = SparkSession.builder()\n  .appName(\"\
            UDAF Example\")\n  .getOrCreate()\n\n// Register the UDAF\nspark.udf.register(\"\
            geometricMean\", new GeometricMean)\n\n// Now you can use your UDAF in\
            \ Spark SQL queries\nval data = spark.read.json(\"path/to/your/data.json\"\
            )\ndata.createOrReplaceTempView(\"data\")\n\nval result = spark.sql(\"\
            SELECT geometricMean(value) FROM data\")\nresult.show()\n```\n\nThis example\
            \ demonstrates how to implement and use a UDAF to calculate the geometric\
            \ mean of a column in a DataFrame. You can adapt this template to create\
            \ other custom aggregation functions as per your requirements."

    user_input: How do I register the UDAF with Spark SQL?
    responses:
    -   responder_name: generated_ground_truth_answer
        response_text: >-
            To register the UDAF with Spark SQL, you can use the following Scala code:


            ```scala

            spark.udf.register("gm", new GeometricMean)

            ```

            This code registers the UDAF with the name "gm" and the instance of the
            GeometricMean class. After registering, you can use the UDAF in your Spark
            SQL queries and DataFrame operations.
        source:
        - 'your buffer schema given an input. override def update(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer,
            input: Row): Unit = { buffer(0) = buffer.getAsLong + 1 buffer(1) = buffer.getAsDouble

            type. override def merge(buffer1: MutableAggregationBuffer, buffer2: Row):
            Unit = { buffer1(0) = buffer1.getAsLong + buffer2.getAsLong buffer1(1)

            To register a User-Defined Aggregate Function (UDAF) with Spark SQL, you
            need to follow these steps:


            1. Create a class that extends the `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` abstract
            class. This class represents the UDAF and defines the logic for initialization,
            updating, merging, and finalizing the aggregation.


            ```scala

            import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.{MutableAggregationBuffer, UserDefinedAggregateFunction}

            import org.apache.spark.sql.types.{DataType, LongType, StructType}

            import org.apache.spark.sql.Row


            class MyUDAF extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction {
              // Define the input schema
              def inputSchema: StructType = ???

              // Define the buffer schema
              def bufferSchema: StructType = ???

              // Define the output data type
              def dataType: DataType = ???

              // Define whether the UDAF is deterministic or not
              def deterministic: Boolean = ???

              // Initialize the buffer
              def initialize(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer): Unit = ???

              // Update the buffer based on a new input row
              def update(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer, input: Row): Unit = ???

              // Merge two buffer values together
              def merge(buffer1: MutableAggregationBuffer, buffer2: Row): Unit = ???

              // Calculate the final result of the aggregation
              def evaluate(buffer: Row): Any = ???
            }

            ```


            2. Implement the methods of the `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` abstract
            class to define the input schema, buffer schema, output data type, determinism,
            initialization, updating, merging, and finalization logic.


            3. Register the UDAF with Spark SQL by calling the `register` method on
            a `SparkSession` object.


            ```scala

            val spark = SparkSession.builder
              .appName("UDAF Example")
              .getOrCreate()

            val myUDAF = new MyUDAF()

            spark.udf.register("my_udaf", myUDAF)

            ```


            4. Now, you can use the registered UDAF in Spark SQL queries.


            ```scala

            val df = spark.read.table("my_table")

            df.createOrReplaceTempView("my_table_view")


            val result = spark.sql("SELECT my_udaf(column) FROM my_table_view")

            result.show()

            ```


            Replace `"my_udaf"` with the desired name for your UDAF, and replace `"column"`
            with the column on which you want to apply the UDAF in your query.


            That's it! You have successfully registered and used a UDAF with Spark
            SQL.

                    to call "group by" since it's an "aggregated function". The answer
                    calls it as a regular UDF, which is not correct. But this is a
                    minor issue since the question is about how to register a UDAF,

            To register the UDAF with Spark SQL, you can follow the steps below:


            1. Create an instance of your UDAF class. For example, if your UDAF class
            is named `GeometricMean`, you can create an instance like this: `val gm
            = new GeometricMean`.


            2. Use the `register` method of the `udf` object in Spark SQL to register
            the UDAF. Pass in a name for the UDAF and the instance of your UDAF class.
            For example: `spark.udf.register("gm", gm)`.


            After registering the UDAF, you can use it in your SQL queries or DataFrame
            operations by referencing the name you assigned during registration.

            You can register the User-Defined Aggregate Function (UDAF) with Spark
            SQL by using the `register` method of the `spark.udf` object. Here is
            how you can do it for a UDAF named "GeometricMean":


            ```scala

            spark.udf.register("gm", new GeometricMean)

            ```


            In this line of code, "gm" is the name you want to assign to the UDAF
            for calling it in Spark SQL commands, and `new GeometricMean` is an instance
            of your UDAF class.

            To register a User-Defined Aggregate Function (UDAF) with Spark SQL, you
            need to follow several steps. Spark offers different ways to create and
            register UDAFs depending on the version of Spark you're using and whether
            you're working with the Dataset/DataFrame API or the RDD API. Below, I'll
            outline a general approach using Spark SQL and Dataset/DataFrame API,
            which is more commonly used in Spark 2.x and above.


            ### For Spark 2.x and Above


            In Spark 2.x and later versions, you can define UDAFs either by extending
            the `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` class for untyped UDAFs or by using
            the `Aggregator` interface for typed UDAFs. Typed UDAFs are generally
            preferred due to better type safety and simpler syntax.


            #### Using `Aggregator` for Typed UDAF


            1. **Define the UDAF Logic**: Implement your UDAF by extending the `Aggregator`
            interface. This involves defining input, buffer, and output schemas by
            overriding methods.

               Here's a simple example that creates a UDAF to calculate the average:

               ```scala
               import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.Aggregator
               import org.apache.spark.sql.Encoder
               import org.apache.spark.sql.Encoders

               case class Average(var sum: Long, var count: Long)

               object MyAverage extends Aggregator[Long, Average, Double] {
                 // How to initialize your buffer.
                 def zero: Average = Average(0L, 0L)
                 // Adds an input row to the buffer
                 def reduce(buffer: Average, input: Long): Average = {
                   buffer.sum += input
                   buffer.count += 1
                   buffer
                 }
                 // Merges two buffers together
                 def merge(b1: Average, b2: Average): Average = {
                   b1.sum += b2.sum
                   b1.count += b2.count
                   b1
                 }
                 // Transforms the buffer to the output
                 def finish(reduction: Average): Double = reduction.sum.toDouble /
            reduction.count
                 // Specifies the Encoder for the intermediate value type
                 def bufferEncoder: Encoder[Average] = Encoders.product
                 // Specifies the Encoder for the final output value type
                 def outputEncoder: Encoder[Double] = Encoders.scalaDouble
               }
               ```

            2. **Register and Use the UDAF**: Once you've defined your UDAF, you can
            register it as a function in Spark SQL and use it in your SQL queries
            or data frame transformations.

               ```scala
               val spark = SparkSession.builder()
                 .appName("UDAF Example")
                 .getOrCreate()

               import spark.implicits._

               // For DataFrame API
               val ds = spark.read.json("path/to/input").as[Long]
               val averageUDAF = MyAverage.toColumn.name("average")
               val result = ds.select(averageUDAF)

               // For Spark SQL
               spark.udf.register("myAverage", MyAverage)
               spark.sql("SELECT myAverage(columnName) FROM tableName").show()
               ```

            ### Older Versions of Spark


            If you're using an older version of Spark (before 2.x), you would typically
            extend the `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` class to create a UDAF. The
            registration process remains similar to what's described above, but the
            implementation details would differ, focusing more on overriding methods
            like `inputSchema`, `bufferSchema`, `dataType`, `deterministic`, `initialize`,
            `update`, `merge`, and `evaluate`.


            ### Conclusion


            Registering a UDAF with Spark SQL involves defining the aggregation logic
            by extending either `Aggregator` or `UserDefinedAggregateFunction`, depending
            on your Spark version and requirements. Once defined, the UDAF can be
            registered with Spark SQL's SQLContext or SparkSession and used in SQL
            queries or DataFrame operations. The above examples illustrate the process
            for typed UDAFs using the `Aggregator` interface, which is recommended
            for Spark 2.x and later versions.

            To register a User-Defined Aggregate Function (UDAF) with Spark SQL, you
            use the `register` method on the SparkSession's UDF registration utility.
            This allows you to make your custom aggregate function available for use
            in Spark SQL queries. Given your implementation of a UDAF named `GeometricMean`,
            here’s how you can register it with Spark SQL in Scala:


            ```scala

            // Assuming you have a SparkSession instance named spark

            import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession


            // Initialize your UDAF

            val gm = new GeometricMean


            // Register your UDAF with Spark SQL, giving it a name, e.g., "gm"

            spark.udf.register("gm", gm)

            ```


            After registration, you can use the `gm` function in your SQL queries
            as you would use any other aggregate function. Here’s an example:


            ```sql

            SELECT group_id, gm(value_column) FROM your_table GROUP BY group_id

            ```


            Or, if you prefer using the DataFrame API:


            ```scala

            import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._


            val df = ... // your DataFrame setup

            df.groupBy("group_id").agg(expr("gm(value_column) as geometric_mean")).show()

            ```


            Remember, for this to work:


            - Ensure you've created a `SparkSession` instance (usually named `spark`
            in documentation and examples).

            - Your UDAF (`GeometricMean` in this case) needs to be correctly implemented
            as per the Spark SQL UDAF interfaces, including methods like `bufferSchema`,
            `update`, `merge`, and `evaluate`.

            - After registration, the name you give to the UDAF (`"gm"` in the example)
            is how you reference it in SQL queries or in the `expr` function within
            the DataFrame API.


            This approach makes it easy to integrate complex aggregation logic into
            Spark SQL transformations, enhancing the expressiveness and capability
            of your data processing pipelines.
