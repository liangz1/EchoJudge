            To implement a UserDefinedAggregateFunction in Scala for Apache Spark
            SQL, you can create a class that extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction.
            This class should override inputSchema, bufferSchema, dataType, deterministic,
            initialize, and update methods. The inputSchema method defines the input
            fields for the aggregate function, while the bufferSchema method defines
            the internal fields for computing the aggregate. The dataType method specifies
            the output type of the aggregation function, and the deterministic method
            indicates whether the function is deterministic. The initialize method
            sets the initial value for the buffer schema, and the update method updates
            the buffer schema given an input.

            This article contains an example of a UDAF and how to register it for
            use in Apache Spark SQL. See User-defined aggregate functions (UDAFs)
            for more details. Implement a `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` ---------------------------------------------

            0L buffer(1) = 1.0 } // This is how to update your buffer schema given
            an input. override def update(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer, input:
            Row): Unit = { buffer(0) = buffer.getAsLong + 1 buffer(1) = buffer.getAsDouble
            * input.getAsDouble }'

            To implement a UserDefinedAggregateFunction (UDAF) in Scala for Apache
            Spark SQL, you need to follow these steps:


            1. Import the necessary Spark SQL classes:

            ```scala

            import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.{MutableAggregationBuffer, UserDefinedAggregateFunction}

            import org.apache.spark.sql.types._

            ```


            2. Extend the UserDefinedAggregateFunction class and override its methods:

            ```scala

            class MyUDAF extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction {

              // Define the input schema for the UDAF
              def inputSchema: StructType = StructType(StructField("input", DoubleType)
            :: Nil)

              // Define the buffer schema for intermediate values
              def bufferSchema: StructType = StructType(StructField("sum", DoubleType)
            :: StructField("count", LongType) :: Nil)

              // Define the output schema of the UDAF
              def dataType: DataType = DoubleType

              // Define whether the UDAF is deterministic or not
              def deterministic: Boolean = true

              // Initialize the buffer values
              def initialize(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer): Unit = {
                buffer(0) = 0.0 // sum
                buffer(1) = 0L  // count
              }

              // Update the buffer values with each input
              def update(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer, input: Row): Unit = {
                if (!input.isNullAt(0)) {
                  buffer(0) = buffer.getDouble(0) + input.getDouble(0) // sum
                  buffer(1) = buffer.getLong(1) + 1L                    // count
                }
              }

              // Merge intermediate buffer values
              def merge(buffer1: MutableAggregationBuffer, buffer2: Row): Unit = {
                buffer1(0) = buffer1.getDouble(0) + buffer2.getDouble(0) // sum
                buffer1(1) = buffer1.getLong(1) + buffer2.getLong(1)     // count
              }

              // Calculate the final result
              def evaluate(buffer: Row): Any = {
                buffer.getDouble(0) / buffer.getLong(1) // average
              }
            }

            ```


            3. Register the UDAF with Spark SQL:

            ```scala

            val myUDAF = new MyUDAF()

            spark.udf.register("my_udaf", myUDAF)

            ```


            4. Use the UDAF in your Spark SQL queries:

            ```scala

            val df = spark.range(1, 100).toDF("value")

            df.createOrReplaceTempView("my_table")

            spark.sql("SELECT my_udaf(value) FROM my_table").show()

            ```


            In the above example, the UDAF calculates the average of a column named
            "value" in the "my_table" DataFrame. You can modify the UDAF implementation
            to perform different aggregations based on your requirements.

                reason: This is actually a pretty good answer even thought no context is provided.
                    However, one drawback is that to use the UDAF, you need to call
                    `select group_id, my_udaf(value) from my_table group by group_id`,
                    where the important part is to call "group by" since it's an "aggregated
                    function". The answer calls it as a regular UDF, which is not correct. But
                    this is a minor issue since the question is about how to implement a UDAF,
                    not focusing on how to use it.

            To implement a `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` in Scala for Apache Spark
            SQL, you need to extend the `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` class and override
            its methods. Here's an example:


            ```scala

            import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.MutableAggregationBuffer

            import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.UserDefinedAggregateFunction

            import org.apache.spark.sql.Row

            import org.apache.spark.sql.types._


            class GeometricMean extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction {
              // This is the input fields for your aggregate function.
              override def inputSchema: org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType =
                StructType(StructField("value", DoubleType) :: Nil)

              // This is the internal fields you keep for computing your aggregate.
              override def bufferSchema: StructType = StructType(
                StructField("count", LongType) ::
                StructField("product", DoubleType) :: Nil
              )

              // This is the output type of your aggregation function.
              override def dataType: DataType = DoubleType

              override def deterministic: Boolean = true

              // This is the initial value for your buffer schema.
              override def initialize(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer): Unit = {
                buffer(0) = 0L // count
                buffer(1) = 1.0 // product
              }

              // This is how to update your buffer schema given an input.
              override def update(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer, input: Row): Unit
            = {
                buffer(0) = buffer.getAs[Long](0) + 1
                buffer(1) = buffer.getAs[Double](1) * input.getAs[Double](0)
              }

              // This is how to merge two objects with the bufferSchema type.
              override def merge(buffer1: MutableAggregationBuffer, buffer2: Row):
            Unit = {
                buffer1(0) = buffer1.getAs[Long](0) + buffer2.getAs[Long](0)
                buffer1(1) = buffer1.getAs[Double](1) * buffer2.getAs[Double](1)
              }

              // This is where you output the final value, given the final value of
            your bufferSchema.
              override def evaluate(buffer: Row): Any = {
                math.pow(buffer.getDouble(1), 1.toDouble / buffer.getLong(0))
              }
            }

            ```


            In this example, we create a `GeometricMean` class that extends `UserDefinedAggregateFunction`.
            We override several methods to define the input schema, buffer schema,
            data type, and behavior of the aggregation function.


            To use this `UserDefinedAggregateFunction`, you need to register it with
            Spark SQL. Here's an example of how to register and use it:


            ```scala

            import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession

            import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._


            val spark = SparkSession.builder()
              .appName("UDAFExample")
              .master("local")
              .getOrCreate()

            // Register the UDAF

            val geometricMean = new GeometricMean()

            spark.udf.register("geometric_mean", geometricMean)


            // Use the UDAF in a SQL query

            val df = spark.range(1, 10).toDF("value")

            df.createOrReplaceTempView("myTable")


            spark.sql("SELECT geometric_mean(value) AS result FROM myTable").show()

            ```


            In this example, we register the `GeometricMean` UDAF as a function named
            "geometric_mean" using `spark.udf.register()`. Then, we can use the UDAF
            in a SQL query by calling the registered function.
