            To run a job every 15 minutes, you can use the following cron syntax:
            `*/15 * * * *`. This means that the job will run every 15 minutes, at
            every hour, every day of the month, every month, and every day of the
            week. You can find more information about cron syntax in the [Quartz Job
            Scheduler CronTrigger Tutorial](https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html)
            documentation.

            Databricks Runtime includes Apache Spark, but it also adds a number of
            components and updates that substantially improve the usability, performance,
            and security of big data analytics. So while Databricks Runtime includes
            Spark, it is not the same as Spark.

            No, Databricks Runtime is not exactly the same as Spark, although it's built upon it. Here's a breakdown of their relationship:

            **Spark:**

            * **Open-source distributed processing framework:** Spark is the core engine for big data processing and analytics. It provides functionalities like distributed data structures, in-memory processing, and fault tolerance.
            * **Standalone software:** You can install and run Spark on your own infrastructure or cloud environment.

            **Databricks Runtime:**

            * **Managed environment for Spark:** Databricks Runtime is a preconfigured runtime environment built on top of Apache Spark. It includes Spark itself and additional features and optimizations developed by Databricks.
            * **Cloud-based platform:** Databricks Runtime runs on Databricks' managed cloud platform, providing features like cluster provisioning, automatic scaling, and integration with other Databricks services.

            **Here's how they differ:**

            * **Features:** Databricks Runtime adds several features to Spark, including Delta Lake for ACID transactions and a unified lake and warehouse, ML libraries like Koalas, and integrations with cloud storage services like Azure Blob Storage.
            * **Usability and performance:** Databricks Runtime focuses on ease of use and optimizes performance for cloud environments. It automatically manages configurations and resources, simplifying cluster management.
            * **Cost:** Databricks Runtime requires a subscription to Databricks platform, while Spark itself is free to use.

            **In summary:**

            * **Think of Spark as the engine, and Databricks Runtime as the souped-up car built around it.** 
            * You can use Spark directly, but Databricks Runtime offers additional features, convenience, and performance optimizations for cloud environments.

            I hope this clarifies the relationship between Databricks Runtime and Spark! Feel free to ask further questions if you'd like to explore any specific aspects.

            Databricks Runtime and Apache Spark are related but not the same. Here's an explanation of their relationship:

            1. **Apache Spark**: This is an open-source, distributed computing system that provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Spark is designed for big data processing and analytics, and it provides APIs in Python, Java, Scala, and R.

            2. **Databricks Runtime**: This is a component of the Databricks Unified Analytics Platform, which is built by the original creators of Apache Spark. Databricks Runtime includes Apache Spark but adds various enhancements and performance optimizations. It is a managed, optimized, and integrated version of Apache Spark, designed to provide better performance and an easier user experience. The Databricks Runtime can include:

                - Optimized Spark: Enhanced version of Spark for better performance.
                - Delta Engine: For high-performance querying.
                - Libraries and Integrations: Pre-installed and optimized libraries for machine learning, graph processing, and more.
                - Enhanced Security and Reliability Features: Additional features for enterprise-level requirements.

            In summary, while Apache Spark is a general-purpose big data processing engine, Databricks Runtime is a more comprehensive and optimized platform that includes Apache Spark along with other enhancements. Users of Databricks Runtime benefit from the familiar Spark APIs and data processing capabilities, but with additional features and optimizations that are not available in the open-source version of Spark.
