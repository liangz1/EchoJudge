Auto Loader automatically detects and processes new files as they arrive in cloud object storage. Use Unity Catalog to manage secure access to external locations. Users or service principals with READ FILES permissions on an external location can use Auto Loader to ingest data. Normally, data will arrive in an external location due to writes from other systems. In this demo, you can simulate data arrival by writing out JSON files to an external location. Copy the code below into a notebook cell. Replace the string value for catalog with the name of a catalog with CREATE CATALOG and USE CATALOG permissions. Replace the string value for external_location with the path for an external location with READ FILES, WRITE FILES, and CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE permissions. External locations can be defined as an entire storage container, but often point to a directory nested in a container. The correct format for an external location path is ""s3://bucket-name/path/to/external_location"". external_location = ""<your-external-location>"" catalog = ""<your-catalog>""","The recommended method for incremental data ingestion in Databricks is by using Delta Lake. Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that provides ACID transactions in Apache Spark and big data workloads. 

Delta Lake allows you to ingest data incrementally by using features such as upserts and merges. It allows you to keep all the historical data, enabling you to perform time travel and audit on the data.

You can perform incremental data ingestion in Delta Lake by using the MERGE INTO statement. This statement can be used to incrementally update and insert data into your Delta Lake tables.

The process generally involves these steps:

1. Load the new data into a DataFrame.
2. Use the DataFrame API or SQL commands to merge the new data into the Delta Lake table.
3. Databricks will handle the rest, ensuring that the data is updated incrementally and that the table is kept in a consistent state.

This method provides a scalable and reliable solution for incremental data ingestion.",The recommended method for incremental data ingestion in Databricks is using Auto Loader. Auto Loader automatically detects and processes new files as they arrive in cloud object storage.

690,What are the considerations when choosing between Auto Loader and COPY INTO for data ingestion in Databricks?,"When choosing between Auto Loader and COPY INTO for data ingestion in Databricks, there are a few considerations to keep in mind. If you're going to ingest files in the order of thousands, you can use COPY INTO. However, if you are expecting files in the order of millions or more over time, it's recommended to use Auto Loader. Auto Loader requires fewer total operations to discover files compared to COPY INTO and can split the processing into multiple batches, making it less expensive and more efficient at scale. These considerations help in determining the most suitable method for data ingestion based on the volume and nature of the data being processed.","Run your first ETL workload on Databricks Load data using streaming tables (Python/SQL notebook) Load data using streaming tables in Databricks SQL Upload local data files or connect external data sources You can securely upload local data files or ingest data from external sources to create tables.

When to use COPY INTO and when to use Auto Loader Here are a few things to consider when choosing between Auto Loader and COPY INTO: If you’re going to ingest files in the order of thousands, you can use COPY INTO. If you are expecting files in the order of millions or more over time, use Auto Loader. Auto Loader requires fewer total operations to discover files compared to COPY INTO and can split the processing into multiple batches, meaning that Auto Loader is less expensive and more efficient at scale. If your data schema is","1. **Data Volume and Frequency**: For large volumes of data or continuous streaming of data, Auto Loader is a better option as it incrementally and efficiently processes new data files as they arrive. COPY INTO is more suitable for one-time or infrequent data loads.

2. **Data Latency**: If you need low-latency data ingestion, Auto Loader is a better choice as it allows near real-time data ingestion.

3. **Complexity of Setup**: Auto Loader requires less complex setup and maintenance as compared to COPY INTO. It automatically manages file state and can handle schema evolution.

4. **Reliability**: Auto Loader provides exactly-once processing guarantees whereas COPY INTO does not.

5. **Source Data Location**: Auto Loader supports data ingestion from cloud storage like S3 or Azure Blob Storage. COPY INTO can ingest data from cloud storage, local file systems, or directly from external databases.

6. **Cost**: Auto Loader may result in higher costs due to continuous monitoring of the source directory and the need for a running Databricks cluster. Copy Into can be more cost-effective for infrequent data loads.

7. **Data Format**: Auto Loader supports various data formats including CSV, JSON, Avro, and binary formats. COPY INTO generally supports CSV and Parquet formats.

8. **Schema Evolution**: Auto Loader supports schema evolution, i.e., it can handle changes in the schema of the ingested data over time. This is not supported by COPY INTO.

9. **Data Transformation**: Auto Loader is more suitable for scenarios where data needs to be transformed before ingestion. COPY INTO is more suitable for scenarios where data can be ingested as-is.

10. **Performance**: For smaller data sets, COPY INTO can be faster as Auto Loader has an initial delay for setting up file state tracking. For larger data sets or continuous data streams, Auto Loader can provide better performance due to incremental processing.","When choosing between Auto Loader and COPY INTO for data ingestion in Databricks, consider the following:

1. Volume of Data Files: If you're expecting to ingest files in the order of thousands, COPY INTO is the suitable choice. However, if you're anticipating files in the order of millions or more over time, Auto Loader is the more efficient option.

2. Efficiency and Cost: Auto Loader requires fewer total operations to discover files compared to COPY INTO and can split the processing into multiple batches. This means that Auto Loader is less expensive and more efficient at scale. 

3. Data Schema: If your data schema is complex or requires frequent updates, the choice between COPY INTO and Auto Loader may also be influenced. However, the given context does not provide specific details about how data schema affects the choice."

To monitor the performance of a machine learning model, you attach the monitor to an inference table that holds the model’s inputs and corresponding predictions. Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring provides the following types of analysis: time series, snapshot, and inference. Profile type Description Time series Compares data distributions across time windows. You specify the granularities over which to calculate metrics (for example, 1 day) to compare how your data distribution changes over time. This type of profile requires a timestamp column. Snapshot In contrast to time series, a snapshot profile monitors how the full contents of the table change over time. Metrics are calculated over all data in the table, and monitor the table state at each","Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring provides various types of analysis including:

890,What is the purpose of a baseline table in Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring?,"The purpose of a baseline table in Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring is to use it as a reference for measuring drift or the change in values over time. It is useful when you have a sample of what you expect your data to look like, and drift is then computed relative to expected data values and distributions. The baseline table should contain a dataset that serves as a reference for measuring changes in the primary table over time.","In contrast to time series, a snapshot profile monitors how the full contents of the table change over time. Metrics are calculated over all data in the table, and monitor the table state at each time the monitor is refreshed. Inference A table containing predicted values output by a machine learning classification or regression model. This table includes a timestamp, a model ID, model inputs (features), a column containing model predictions, and optional columns containing unique observation IDs and ground truth labels. It may also contain metadata, such as demographic information, that is not used as input to the model but might be useful for fairness and bias investigations or other monitoring. An inference profile is similar to a time series profile but also includes model quality metrics. This section briefly describes the input tables used by Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring and the metric tables it produces. The diagram shows the relationship between the input tables, the metric tables, the monitor, and the dashboard. Primary table and baseline table In addition to the table to be monitored, called the “primary table”, you can optionally specify a baseline table to use as a reference for measuring drift, or the change in values over time. A baseline table is useful when you have a sample of what you expect your data to look like. The idea is that drift is then computed relative to expected data values and distributions. The baseline table should contain a dataset that","A baseline table in Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring is used to store historical data for comparison purposes.

1200,How do I read binary files using Databricks Runtime?,"To read binary files using Databricks Runtime, you can use the binary file data source. This data source converts each file into a single record that contains the raw content and metadata of the file. The produced DataFrame includes columns such as `path`, `modificationTime`, `length`, and `content`. Additionally, you can specify the data source format as `binaryFile` to read binary files. An example of reading binary files is shown below:

```python
# Read binary files

# Specify the data source format as binaryFile

# Load binary files

df = spark.read.format(""binaryFile"").load(""path_to_files"")

# Display the DataFrame

display(df) # image thumbnails are rendered in the ""content"" column
```","Binary file ============= Databricks Runtime supports the binary file data source, which reads binary files and converts each file into a single record that contains the raw content and metadata of the file. The binary file data source produces a DataFrame with the following columns and possibly partition columns: * `path (StringType)` : The path of the file. * `modificationTime (TimestampType)` : The modification time of the file. In some Hadoop FileSystem implementations, this parameter might be unavailable and the value would be set to a default value. * `length (LongType)` : The length of the file in bytes. * `content (BinaryType)` : The contents of the file. To read binary files, specify the data source `format` as `binaryFile` . Images -------- Databricks recommends that you use the binary file data source to load image data. The Databricks `display` function supports displaying image data loaded using the binary data source. If all the loaded files have a file name with an image extension , image preview is automatically enabled: ```python df = spark.read.format(""binaryFile"").load("""") display(df) # image thumbnails are rendered in the ""content"" column ``` !image preview Alternatively, you can force the image preview functionality by using the `mimeType` option with a string value `""image/*""` to annotate the binary column. Images are decoded based on their format information in the binary content. Supported image types are `bmp` , `gif` , `jpeg` , and `png` .","Reading binary files in Databricks runtime can be accomplished using the spark.read.format(""binaryFile"") function. Here's an example:

```python
# Define the path to the binary file
path = ""/path/to/binary/files""

# Read the binary file
df = spark.read.format(""binaryFile"").load(path)

# Display the DataFrame
display(df)
```

The resulting DataFrame will have the following columns:

- `path`: StringType - The file path.
- `modificationTime`: TimestampType - The modification time of the file.
- `length`: LongType - The length of the file in bytes.
- `content`: BinaryType - The content of the file.

Please note that binary file format is available since Spark 2.3 and in Databricks Runtime 4.0 and above.","To read binary files using Databricks Runtime, you need to specify the data source format as `binaryFile`. Here is an example in Python:

```python
df = spark.read.format(""binaryFile"").load(""path_to_your_file"")
```

In this example, `df` is a DataFrame that will contain the raw content and metadata of the binary file, including the path of the file, the modification time of the file, the length of the file in bytes, and the content of the file. Please replace `""path_to_your_file""` with the actual path of the binary file you want to read."

4760,How do I implement a UserDefinedAggregateFunction in Scala for Apache Spark SQL?,"To implement a UserDefinedAggregateFunction in Scala for Apache Spark SQL, you can create a class that extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction. This class should override inputSchema, bufferSchema, dataType, deterministic, initialize, and update methods. The inputSchema method defines the input fields for the aggregate function, while the bufferSchema method defines the internal fields for computing the aggregate. The dataType method specifies the output type of the aggregation function, and the deterministic method indicates whether the function is deterministic. The initialize method sets the initial value for the buffer schema, and the update method updates the buffer schema given an input.","User-defined aggregate functions - Scala ========================================== This article contains an example of a UDAF and how to register it for use in Apache Spark SQL.

Here is an example of a UDAF that computes the average of a given column:

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.Row
import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.{MutableAggregationBuffer, UserDefinedAggregateFunction}
import org.apache.spark.sql.types._

class Average extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction {
  // Data types of input arguments of this aggregate function
  def inputSchema: StructType = StructType(StructField(""inputColumn"", DoubleType) :: Nil)
  
  // Data types of values in the aggregation buffer
  def bufferSchema: StructType = {
    StructType(StructField(""sum"", DoubleType) :: StructField(""count"", LongType) :: Nil)
  }
  
  // The data type of the returned value
  def dataType: DataType = DoubleType
  
  // Whether this function always returns the same output on the identical input
  def deterministic: Boolean = true
  
  // Initializes the given aggregation buffer. The buffer should be zeroed out.
  def initialize(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer): Unit = {
    buffer(0) = 0.0
    buffer(1) = 0L
  }
  
  // Updates the given aggregation buffer `buffer` with new input data from `input`
  def update(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer, input: Row): Unit = {
    buffer(0) = buffer.getDouble(0) + input.getDouble(0)
    buffer(1) = buffer.getLong(1) + 1
  }
  
  // Merges two aggregation buffers and stores the updated buffer values back to `buffer1`

  }
  
  // Calculates the final result
  def evaluate(buffer: Row): Double = buffer.getDouble(0) / buffer.getLong(1)
}
```

You can then use this UDAF in your Spark SQL expressions:

```scala
val spark: SparkSession = ...
import spark.implicits._

val average = new Average
spark.udf.register(""average"", average)

val df = Seq((1, ""a"", 10.0), (2, ""b"", 20.0), (3, ""a"", 30.0), (4, ""b"", 40.0)).toDF(""id"", ""category"", ""value"")

df.createOrReplaceTempView(""df"")
spark.sql(""SELECT category, average(value) as avg_value FROM df GROUP BY category"").show
```

Note: 

- The `inputSchema` defines the input parameters for our function. In our case, we are simply taking a single DoubleType input which represents the value for each row that our function will be applied on.
- The `bufferSchema` represents intermediate results that are going to be used during aggregation.
- The `dataType` represents the type of the result of the function.
- The `deterministic` method is to specify whether the function is deterministic (i.e. given the same input, the function always produces the same output).
- The `initialize` method is used to initialize the buffer for aggregation. Here we are initializing the sum as 0.0 and count as 0.
- The `update` method takes a row and updates the buffer.
- The `merge` method is used to merge two buffers during aggregation.
- The `evaluate` method generates the final result of aggregation.
","To implement a UserDefinedAggregateFunction in Scala for Apache Spark SQL, you have to extend the UserDefinedAggregateFunction class and implement the necessary methods. Here is a step-by-step process:

1. Import the necessary classes:
```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.MutableAggregationBuffer
import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.UserDefinedAggregateFunction
import org.apache.spark.sql.Row
import org.apache.spark.sql.types._
```

2. Define your class that extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction:
```scala
class GeometricMean extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction {
```

3. Define the input fields for your aggregate function:
```scala
override def inputSchema: org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType = 
    StructType(StructField(""value"", DoubleType) :: Nil)
```

4. Define the internal fields for computing your aggregate:
```scala
override def bufferSchema: StructType = StructType(
    StructField(""count"", LongType) :: StructField(""product"", DoubleType) :: Nil)
```

5. Define the output type of your aggregation function:
```scala
override def dataType: DataType = DoubleType
```

6. Return true for deterministic to let Spark know that your function always gives the same output for the same input:
```scala
override def deterministic: Boolean = true
```

7. Define the initial value for your buffer schema:
```scala
override def initialize(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer): Unit = {
    buffer(0) = 0L
    buffer(1) = 1.0
}
```

8. Define how to update your buffer schema given an input:
```scala
override def update(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer, input: Row): Unit = {
    buffer(0) = buffer.getAs[Long](0) + 1
    buffer(1) = buffer.getAs[Double](1) * input.getAs[Double](0)
}
```

Please, ensure you replace `GeometricMean` with the appropriate class name and update the `inputSchema`, `bufferSchema`, `dataType`, `initialize`, `update` methods according to your specific needs."
4770,How do I register the UDAF with Spark SQL?,"To register the UDAF with Spark SQL, you can use the following Scala code:

```scala
spark.udf.register(""gm"", new GeometricMean)
```
This code registers the UDAF with the name ""gm"" and the instance of the GeometricMean class. After registering, you can use the UDAF in your Spark SQL queries and DataFrame operations.","your buffer schema given an input. override def update(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer, input: Row): Unit = { buffer(0) = buffer.getAsLong + 1 buffer(1) = buffer.getAsDouble * input.getAsDouble } // This is how to merge two objects with the bufferSchema type. override def merge(buffer1: MutableAggregationBuffer, buffer2: Row): Unit = { buffer1(0) = buffer1.getAsLong + buffer2.getAsLong buffer1(1) = buffer1.getAsDouble * buffer2.getAsDouble } // This is where you output the final value, given the final value of your bufferSchema. override def evaluate(buffer: Row): Any = { math.pow(buffer.getDouble(1), 1.toDouble / buffer.getLong(0)) } } ``` Register the UDAF with Spark SQL ---------------------------------- ```scala spark.udf.register(""gm"", new GeometricMean) ``` Use your UDAF --------------- ```scala // Create a DataFrame and Spark SQL table import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._ val ids = spark.range(1, 20) ids.createOrReplaceTempView(""ids"") val df = spark.sql(""select id, id % 3 as group_id from ids"") df.createOrReplaceTempView(""simple"") ``` ```sql -- Use a group_by statement and call the UDAF. select group_id, gm(id) from simple group by group_id ``` ```scala // Or use DataFrame syntax to call the aggregate function. // Create an instance of UDAF GeometricMean. val gm = new GeometricMean // Show the geometric mean of values of column ""id"". df.groupBy(""group_id"").agg(gm(col(""id"")).as(""GeometricMean"")).show() // Invoke the UDAF by its assigned name.","To register a User-Defined Aggregate Function (UDAF) with Spark SQL, you can use the `spark.udf.register` method. Here's an example:

1. Define your UDAF class. For instance, you can extend the `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` class:

```scala
import org.apache.spark.sql.Row
import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.{MutableAggregationBuffer, UserDefinedAggregateFunction}
import org.apache.spark.sql.types._

class MyAverage extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction {
  def inputSchema: StructType =
    StructType(StructField(""inputColumn"", LongType) :: Nil)
  def bufferSchema: StructType = 
    StructType(StructField(""sum"", LongType) :: StructField(""count"", LongType) :: Nil)
  def dataType: DataType = DoubleType
  def deterministic: Boolean = true
  def initialize(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer): Unit = {
    buffer(0) = 0L
    buffer(1) = 0L
  }
  def update(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer, input: Row): Unit = {
    if (!input.isNullAt(0)) {
      buffer(0) = buffer.getLong(0) + input.getLong(0)
      buffer(1) = buffer.getLong(1) + 1
    }
  }
  def merge(buffer1: MutableAggregationBuffer, buffer2: Row): Unit = {
    buffer1(0) = buffer1.getLong(0) + buffer2.getLong(0)
    buffer1(1) = buffer1.getLong(1) + buffer2.getLong(1)
  }
  def evaluate(buffer: Row): Double = buffer.getLong(0).toDouble / buffer.getLong(1)
}
```

2. Register your UDAF with Spark SQL:

```scala
val spark: SparkSession = ...
val myAverage = new MyAverage
spark.udf.register(""myAverage"", myAverage)
```

3. Use your UDAF in Spark SQL:

```scala
val df = spark.read.json(""examples/src/main/resources/employees.json"")
df.createOrReplaceTempView(""employees"")
df.show()
// +-------+------+
// |   name|salary|
// +-------+------+
// |Michael|  3000|
// |   Andy|  4500|
// | Justin|  3500|
// |  Berta|  4000|
// +-------+------+

val result = spark.sql(""SELECT myAverage(salary) as average_salary FROM employees"")
result.show()
// +--------------+
// |average_salary|
// +--------------+
// |        3750.0|
// +--------------+
```

Please replace `myAverage` and `salary` with the actual names of your UDAF and target column.","You can register the User-Defined Aggregate Function (UDAF) with Spark SQL by using the `register` method of the `spark.udf` object. Here is how you can do it for a UDAF named ""GeometricMean"":

```scala
spark.udf.register(""gm"", new GeometricMean)
```

In this line of code, ""gm"" is the name you want to assign to the UDAF for calling it in Spark SQL commands, and `new GeometricMean` is an instance of your UDAF class."
