pero en lenguaje r,"Lo siento, parece que me equivoqué en mi respuesta anterior. Para obtener la fecha y hora de la última modificación de una tabla en Databricks utilizando R, puedes utilizar la función `dbutils.fs.ls()` para obtener información sobre el archivo de la tabla y luego extraer la fecha y hora de la última modificación de la información.

Aquí te dejo un ejemplo de cómo hacerlo:

```R
# Ruta de la tabla
ruta_tabla <- ""/ruta/a/tu/tabla""

# Obtener información sobre el archivo de la tabla
info_archivo <- dbutils.fs.ls(ruta_tabla)

# Extraer la fecha y hora de la última modificación
fecha_modificacion <- info_archivo$modificationTime

print(paste(""La tabla fue modificada por última vez en:"", fecha_modificacion))
```

Ten en cuenta que esta función solo está disponible para tablas que se han creado en Databricks. Si estás utilizando una tabla externa, como una tabla de una base de datos relacional, es posible que esta función no esté disponible.",https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sparkr/overview,"['Para saber cuándo se actualizó una tabla en Databricks utilizando R, puedes utilizar la función `last_modified` de la clase `Table` de la librería `SparkR`. Aquí te dejo un ejemplo de cómo podrías utilizarla:\n\n```\nlibrary(SparkR)\n\n# Cargar una tabla existente\ndf <- read.df(""ruta/a/tu/tabla.csv"", source = ""csv"", header = ""true"")\n\n# Obtener la fecha y hora de la última modificación\nlast_modified_time <- last_modified(df)\nprint(last_modified_time)\n```\n\nEsto imprimirá la fecha y hora de la última modificación de la tabla en formato `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`. Puedes adaptar este código para que se ajuste a tus necesidades específicas.']","['# SparkR overview\n\nSparkR is an R package that provides a light-weight frontend to use Apache Spark from R. SparkR also supports distributed machine learning using MLlib.\n\n## SparkR function reference\n\nYou can find the latest SparkR function reference on\n[spark.apache.org](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/R/index.html).\n\nYou can also view function help in R notebooks or RStudio after you import the SparkR\npackage.\n\n![Embedded R documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/inline-r-docs.png)\n\n## SparkR in notebooks\n\n* For Spark 2.0 and above, you do not need to explicitly pass a `sqlContext` object to every function call.\n* For Spark 2.2 and above, notebooks no longer import SparkR by default because SparkR functions were conflicting with similarly named functions from other popular packages. To use SparkR you can call `library(SparkR)` in your notebooks. The SparkR session is already configured, and all SparkR functions will talk to your attached cluster using the existing session.\n\n## SparkR in spark-submit jobs\n\nYou can run scripts that use SparkR on Azure Databricks as spark-submit jobs, with minor code modifications.\n\n## Create SparkR DataFrames\n\nYou can create a DataFrame from a local R `data.frame`, from a data source, or using a Spark SQL query.\n\n### From a local R `data.frame`\n\nThe simplest way to create a DataFrame is to convert a local R `data.frame` into a\n`SparkDataFrame`. Specifically we can use `createDataFrame` and pass in the local R\n`data.frame` to create a `SparkDataFrame`. Like most other SparkR functions, `createDataFrame`\nsyntax changed in Spark 2.0. You can see examples of this in the code snippet bellow.\nFor more examples, see [createDataFrame](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/R/reference/createDataFrame.html).\n\n```\nlibrary(SparkR)\ndf <- createDataFrame(faithful)\n\n# Displays the content of the DataFrame to stdout\nhead(df)\n\n```\n\n### Using the data source API\n\nThe general method for creating a DataFrame from a data source is `read.df`.\nThis method takes the path for the file to load and the type of data source.\nSparkR supports reading CSV, JSON, text, and Parquet files\nnatively.\n\n```\nlibrary(SparkR)\ndiamondsDF <- read.df(""/databricks-datasets/Rdatasets/data-001/csv/ggplot2/diamonds.csv"", source = ""csv"", header=""true"", inferSchema = ""true"")\nhead(diamondsDF)\n\n```\n\nSparkR automatically infers the schema from the CSV file.\n\n#### Adding a data source connector with Spark Packages\n\nThrough Spark Packages you can find data source connectors\nfor popular file formats such as Avro. As an example, use the\n[spark-avro package](https://spark-packages.org/package/databricks/spark-avro)\nto load an [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) file. The availability of the spark-avro package depends on your cluster’s [image version](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/runtime/index.html). See [Avro file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/avro.html).\n\nFirst take an existing `data.frame`, convert to a Spark DataFrame, and save it as an Avro file.\n\n```\nrequire(SparkR)\nirisDF <- createDataFrame(iris)\nwrite.df(irisDF, source = ""com.databricks.spark.avro"", path = ""dbfs:/tmp/iris.avro"", mode = ""overwrite"")\n\n```\n\nTo verify that an Avro file was saved:\n\n```\n%fs ls /tmp/iris.avro\n\n```\n\nNow use the spark-avro package again to read back the data.\n\n```\nirisDF2 <- read.df(path = ""/tmp/iris.avro"", source = ""com.databricks.spark.avro"")\nhead(irisDF2)\n\n```\n\nThe data source API can also be used to save DataFrames into\nmultiple file formats. For example, you can save the DataFrame from the\nprevious example to a Parquet file using `write.df`.\n\n```\nwrite.df(irisDF2, path=""dbfs:/tmp/iris.parquet"", source=""parquet"", mode=""overwrite"")\n\n```\n\n```\n%fs ls dbfs:/tmp/iris.parquet\n\n```\n\n### From a Spark SQL query\n\nYou can also create SparkR DataFrames using Spark SQL queries.\n\n```\n# Register earlier df as temp view\ncreateOrReplaceTempView(irisDF2, ""irisTemp"")\n\n```\n\n```\n# Create a df consisting of only the \'species\' column using a Spark SQL query\nspecies <- sql(""SELECT species FROM irisTemp"")\n\n```\n\n`species` is a SparkDataFrame.\n\n## DataFrame operations\n\nSpark DataFrames support a number of functions to do structured data\nprocessing. Here are some basic examples. A complete list can\nbe found in the [API docs](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/R/).\n\n### Select rows and columns\n\n```\n# Import SparkR package if this is a new notebook\nrequire(SparkR)\n\n# Create DataFrame\ndf <- createDataFrame(faithful)\n\n```\n\n```\n# Select only the ""eruptions"" column\nhead(select(df, df$eruptions))\n\n```\n\n```\n# You can also pass in column name as strings\nhead(select(df, ""eruptions""))\n\n```\n\n```\n# Filter the DataFrame to only retain rows with wait times shorter than 50 mins\nhead(filter(df, df$waiting < 50))\n\n```\n\n### Grouping and aggregation\n\nSparkDataFrames support a number of commonly used functions to\naggregate data after grouping. For example you can count the number of\ntimes each waiting time appears in the faithful dataset.\n\n```\nhead(count(groupBy(df, df$waiting)))\n\n```\n\n```\n# You can also sort the output from the aggregation to get the most common waiting times\nwaiting_counts <- count(groupBy(df, df$waiting))\nhead(arrange(waiting_counts, desc(waiting_counts$count)))\n\n```\n\n### Column operations\n\nSparkR provides a number of functions that can be directly applied to\ncolumns for data processing and aggregation. The following example shows the\nuse of basic arithmetic functions.\n\n```\n# Convert waiting time from hours to seconds.\n# You can assign this to a new column in the same DataFrame\ndf$waiting_secs <- df$waiting \\* 60\nhead(df)\n\n```\n\n## Machine learning\n\nSparkR exposes most of MLLib algorithms. Under the hood, SparkR\nuses MLlib to train the model.\n\nThe following example shows how to build a gaussian GLM model using\nSparkR. To run linear regression, set family to `&quot;gaussian&quot;`. To run\nlogistic regression, set family to `&quot;binomial&quot;`. When using SparkML GLM SparkR\nautomatically performs one-hot encoding of\ncategorical features so that it does not need to be done manually.\nBeyond String and Double type features, it is also possible to fit over\nMLlib Vector features, for compatibility with other MLlib components.\n\n```\n# Create the DataFrame\ndf <- createDataFrame(iris)\n\n# Fit a linear model over the dataset.\nmodel <- glm(Sepal_Length ~ Sepal_Width + Species, data = df, family = ""gaussian"")\n\n# Model coefficients are returned in a similar format to R\'s native glm().\nsummary(model)\n\n```\n\nFor tutorials, see [Tutorial: Analyze data with glm](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sparkr/glm-tutorial.html).\n\nFor additional examples, see [Work with DataFrames and tables in R](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sparkr/dataframes-tables.html).\n']",['https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sparkr/overview'],"[

SparkR also supports distributed machine learning using MLlib.\n\n## SparkR function reference\n\nYou can find the latest SparkR function reference on\n[spark.apache.org](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/R/index.html).\n\nYou can also view function help in R notebooks or RStudio after you import the SparkR\npackage.\n\n![Embedded R documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/inline-r-docs.png)\n\n## SparkR in notebooks\n\n* For Spark 2.0 and above, you do not need to explicitly pass a `sqlContext` object to every function call.\n* For Spark 2.2 and above, notebooks no longer import SparkR by default because SparkR functions were conflicting with similarly named functions from other popular packages. To use SparkR you can call `library(SparkR)` in your notebooks. The SparkR session is already configured, and all SparkR functions will talk to your attached cluster using the existing session.\n\n## SparkR in spark-submit jobs\n\nYou can run scripts that use SparkR on Azure Databricks as spark-submit jobs, with minor code modifications.\n\n## Create SparkR DataFrames\n\nYou can create a DataFrame from a local R `data.frame`, from a data source, or using a Spark SQL query.\n\n### From a local R `data.frame`\n\nThe simplest way to create a DataFrame is to convert a local R `data.frame` into a\n`SparkDataFrame`. Specifically we can use `createDataFrame` and pass in the local R\n`data.frame` to create a `SparkDataFrame`. Like most other SparkR functions, `createDataFrame`\nsyntax changed in Spark 2.0. You can see examples of this in the code snippet bellow.\nFor more examples, see [createDataFrame](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/R/reference/createDataFrame.html).\n\n```\nlibrary(SparkR)\ndf <- createDataFrame(faithful)\n\n# Displays the content of the DataFrame to stdout\nhead(df)\n\n```\n\n### Using the data source API\n\nThe general method for creating a DataFrame from a data source is `read.df`.\nThis method takes the path for the file to load and the type of data source.\nSparkR supports reading CSV, JSON, text, and Parquet files\nnatively.\n\n```\nlibrary(SparkR)\ndiamondsDF <- read.df(\""/databricks-datasets/Rdatasets/data-001/csv/ggplot2/diamonds.csv\"", source = \""csv\"", header=\""true\"", inferSchema = \""true\"")\nhead(diamondsDF)\n\n```\n\nSparkR automatically infers the schema from the CSV file.\n\n#### Adding a data source connector with Spark Packages\n\nThrough Spark Packages you can find data source connectors\nfor popular file formats such as Avro. As an example, use the\n[spark-avro package](https://spark-packages.org/package/databricks/spark-avro)\nto load an [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) file. The availability of the spark-avro package depends on your cluster\u2019s [image version](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/runtime/index.html). See [Avro file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/avro.html).\n\nFirst take an existing `data.frame`, convert to a Spark DataFrame, and save it as an Avro file.\n\n```\nrequire(SparkR)\nirisDF <- createDataFrame(iris)\nwrite.df(irisDF, source = \""com.databricks.spark.avro\"", path = \""dbfs:/tmp/iris.avro\"", mode = \""overwrite\"")\n\n```\n\nTo verify that an Avro file was saved:\n\n```\n%fs ls /tmp/iris.avro\n\n```\n\nNow use the spark-avro package again to read back the data.\n\n```\nirisDF2 <- read.df(path = \""/tmp/iris.avro\"", source = \""com.databricks.spark.avro\"")\nhead(irisDF2)\n\n```\n\nThe data source API can also be used to save DataFrames into\nmultiple file formats. For example, you can save the DataFrame from the\nprevious example to a Parquet file using `write.df`.\n\n```\nwrite.df(irisDF2, path=\""dbfs:/tmp/iris.parquet\"", source=\""parquet\"", mode=\""overwrite\"")\n\n```\n\n```\n%fs ls dbfs:/tmp/iris.parquet\n\n```\n\n### From a Spark SQL query\n\nYou can also create SparkR DataFrames using Spark SQL queries.\n\n```\n# Register earlier df as temp view\ncreateOrReplaceTempView(irisDF2, \""irisTemp\"")\n\n```\n\n```\n# Create a df consisting of only the 'species' column using a Spark SQL query\nspecies <- sql(\""SELECT species FROM irisTemp\"")\n\n```\n\n`species` is a SparkDataFrame.\n\n## DataFrame operations\n\nSpark DataFrames support a number of functions to do structured data\nprocessing. Here are some basic examples. A complete list can\nbe found in the [API docs](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/R/).\n\n### Select rows and columns\n\n```\n# Import SparkR package if this is a new notebook\nrequire(SparkR)\n\n# Create DataFrame\ndf <- createDataFrame(faithful)\n\n```\n\n```\n# Select only the \""eruptions\"" column\nhead(select(df, df$eruptions))\n\n```\n\n```\n# You can also pass in column name as strings\nhead(select(df, \""eruptions\""))\n\n```\n\n```\n# Filter the DataFrame to only retain rows with wait times shorter than 50 mins\nhead(filter(df, df$waiting < 50))\n\n```\n\n### Grouping and aggregation\n\nSparkDataFrames support a number of commonly used functions to\naggregate data after grouping. For example you can count the number of\ntimes each waiting time appears in the faithful dataset.\n\n```\nhead(count(groupBy(df, df$waiting)))\n\n```\n\n```\n# You can also sort the output from the aggregation to get the most common waiting times\nwaiting_counts <- count(groupBy(df, df$waiting))\nhead(arrange(waiting_counts, desc(waiting_counts$count)))\n\n```\n\n### Column operations\n\nSparkR provides a number of functions that can be directly applied to\ncolumns for data processing and aggregation. The following example shows the\nuse of basic arithmetic functions.\n\n```\n# Convert waiting time from hours to seconds.\n# You can assign this to a new column in the same DataFrame\ndf$waiting_secs <- df$waiting \\* 60\nhead(df)\n\n```\n\n## Machine learning\n\nSparkR exposes most of MLLib algorithms. Under the hood, SparkR\nuses MLlib to train the model.\n\nThe following example shows how to build a gaussian GLM model using\nSparkR. To run linear regression, set family to `&quot;gaussian&quot;`. To run\nlogistic regression, set family to `&quot;binomial&quot;`. When using SparkML GLM SparkR\nautomatically performs one-hot encoding of\ncategorical features so that it does not need to be done manually.\nBeyond String and Double type features, it is also possible to fit over\nMLlib Vector features, for compatibility with other MLlib components.\n\n```\n# Create the DataFrame\ndf <- createDataFrame(iris)\n\n# Fit a linear model over the dataset.\nmodel <- glm(Sepal_Length ~ Sepal_Width + Species, data = df, family = \""gaussian\"")\n\n# Model coefficients are returned in a similar format to R's native glm().\nsummary(model)\n\n```\n\nFor tutorials, see [Tutorial: Analyze data with glm](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sparkr/glm-tutorial.html).\n\nFor additional examples, see [Work with DataFrames and tables in R](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sparkr/dataframes-tables.html).\n""

                    ""content"": ""# SparkR overview\n\nSparkR is an R package that provides a light-weight frontend to use Apache Spark from R. SparkR also supports distributed machine learning using MLlib.\n\n## SparkR function reference\n\nYou can find the latest SparkR function reference on\n[spark.apache.org](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/R/index.html).\n\nYou can also view function help in R notebooks or RStudio after you import the SparkR\npackage.\n\n![Embedded R documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/inline-r-docs.png)\n\n## SparkR in notebooks\n\n* For Spark 2.0 and above, you do not need to explicitly pass a `sqlContext` object to every function call.\n* For Spark 2.2 and above, notebooks no longer import SparkR by default because SparkR functions were conflicting with similarly named functions from other popular packages. To use SparkR you can call `library(SparkR)` in your notebooks. The SparkR session is already configured, and all SparkR functions will talk to your attached cluster using the existing session.\n\n## SparkR in spark-submit jobs\n\nYou can run scripts that use SparkR on Azure Databricks as spark-submit jobs, with minor code modifications.\n\n## Create SparkR DataFrames\n\nYou can create a DataFrame from a local R `data.frame`, from a data source, or using a Spark SQL query.\n\n### From a local R `data.frame`\n\nThe simplest way to create a DataFrame is to convert a local R `data.frame` into a\n`SparkDataFrame`. Specifically we can use `createDataFrame` and pass in the local R\n`data.frame` to create a `SparkDataFrame`. Like most other SparkR functions, `createDataFrame`\nsyntax changed in Spark 2.0. You can see examples of this in the code snippet bellow.\nFor more examples, see [createDataFrame](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/R/reference/createDataFrame.html).\n\n```\nlibrary(SparkR)\ndf <- createDataFrame(faithful)\n\n# Displays the content of the DataFrame to stdout\nhead(df)\n\n```\n\n### Using the data source API\n\nThe general method for creating a DataFrame from a data source is `read.df`.\nThis method takes the path for the file to load and the type of data source.\nSparkR supports reading CSV, JSON, text, and Parquet files\nnatively.\n\n```\nlibrary(SparkR)\ndiamondsDF <- read.df(\""/databricks-datasets/Rdatasets/data-001/csv/ggplot2/diamonds.csv\"", source = \""csv\"", header=\""true\"", inferSchema = \""true\"")\nhead(diamondsDF)\n\n```\n\nSparkR automatically infers the schema from the CSV file.\n\n#### Adding a data source connector with Spark Packages\n\nThrough Spark Packages you can find data source connectors\nfor popular file formats such as Avro. As an example, use the\n[spark-avro package](https://spark-packages.org/package/databricks/spark-avro)\nto load an [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/) file. The availability of the spark-avro package depends on your cluster\u2019s [image version](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/runtime/index.html). See [Avro file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/avro.html).\n\nFirst take an existing `data.frame`, convert to a Spark DataFrame, and save it as an Avro file.\n\n```\nrequire(SparkR)\nirisDF <- createDataFrame(iris)\nwrite.df(irisDF, source = \""com.databricks.spark.avro\"", path = \""dbfs:/tmp/iris.avro\"", mode = \""overwrite\"")\n\n```\n\nTo verify that an Avro file was saved:\n\n```\n%fs ls /tmp/iris.avro\n\n```\n\nNow use the spark-avro package again to read back the data.\n\n```\nirisDF2 <- read.df(path = \""/tmp/iris.avro\"", source = \""com.databricks.spark.avro\"")\nhead(irisDF2)\n\n```\n\nThe data source API can also be used to save DataFrames into\nmultiple file formats. For example, you can save the DataFrame from the\nprevious example to a Parquet file using `write.df`.\n\n```\nwrite.df(irisDF2, path=\""dbfs:/tmp/iris.parquet\"", source=\""parquet\"", mode=\""overwrite\"")\n\n```\n\n```\n%fs ls dbfs:/tmp/iris.parquet\n\n```\n\n### From a Spark SQL query\n\nYou can also create SparkR DataFrames using Spark SQL queries.\n\n```\n# Register earlier df as temp view\ncreateOrReplaceTempView(irisDF2, \""irisTemp\"")\n\n```\n\n```\n# Create a df consisting of only the 'species' column using a Spark SQL query\nspecies <- sql(\""SELECT species FROM irisTemp\"")\n\n```\n\n`species` is a SparkDataFrame.\n\n## DataFrame operations\n\nSpark DataFrames support a number of functions to do structured data\nprocessing. Here are some basic examples. A complete list can\nbe found in the [API docs](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/R/).\n\n### Select rows and columns\n\n```\n# Import SparkR package if this is a new notebook\nrequire(SparkR)\n\n# Create DataFrame\ndf <- createDataFrame(faithful)\n\n```\n\n```\n# Select only the \""eruptions\"" column\nhead(select(df, df$eruptions))\n\n```\n\n```\n# You can also pass in column name as strings\nhead(select(df, \""eruptions\""))\n\n```\n\n```\n# Filter the DataFrame to only retain rows with wait times shorter than 50 mins\nhead(filter(df, df$waiting < 50))\n\n```\n\n### Grouping and aggregation\n\nSparkDataFrames support a number of commonly used functions to\naggregate data after grouping. For example you can count the number of\ntimes each waiting time appears in the faithful dataset.\n\n```\nhead(count(groupBy(df, df$waiting)))\n\n```\n\n```\n# You can also sort the output from the aggregation to get the most common waiting times\nwaiting_counts <- count(groupBy(df, df$waiting))\nhead(arrange(waiting_counts, desc(waiting_counts$count)))\n\n```\n\n### Column operations\n\nSparkR provides a number of functions that can be directly applied to\ncolumns for data processing and aggregation. The following example shows the\nuse of basic arithmetic functions.\n\n```\n# Convert waiting time from hours to seconds.\n# You can assign this to a new column in the same DataFrame\ndf$waiting_secs <- df$waiting \\* 60\nhead(df)\n\n```\n\n## Machine learning\n\nSparkR exposes most of MLLib algorithms. Under the hood, SparkR\nuses MLlib to train the model.\n\nThe following example shows how to build a gaussian GLM model using\nSparkR. To run linear regression, set family to `&quot;gaussian&quot;`. To run\nlogistic regression, set family to `&quot;binomial&quot;`. When using SparkML GLM SparkR\nautomatically performs one-hot encoding of\ncategorical features so that it does not need to be done manually.\nBeyond String and Double type features, it is also possible to fit over\nMLlib Vector features, for compatibility with other MLlib components.\n\n```\n# Create the DataFrame\ndf <- createDataFrame(iris)\n\n# Fit a linear model over the dataset.\nmodel <- glm(Sepal_Length ~ Sepal_Width + Species, data = df, family = \""gaussian\"")\n\n# Model coefficients are returned in a similar format to R's native glm().\nsummary(model)\n\n```\n\nFor tutorials, see [Tutorial: Analyze data with glm](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sparkr/glm-tutorial.html).\n\nFor additional examples, see [Work with DataFrames and tables in R](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sparkr/dataframes-tables.html).\n""

This article provides information to help you identify formats and integrations that have built-in support. You can also discover ways to extend Azure Databricks to interact with even more systems. Most data on Azure Databricks live in cloud object storage. See [Where\u2019s my data?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/storage/index.html).\n\nAzure Databricks provides a number of optimizations for [data loading and ingestion](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/ingestion/index.html).\n\nAzure Databricks also supports query federation. See [Run queries using Lakehouse Federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/query-federation/index.html).\n\nIf you have not read or written data with Azure Databricks before, consider reviewing the DataFrames tutorial for [Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/getting-started/dataframes-python.html) or [Scala](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/getting-started/dataframes-scala.html). Even for users familiar with Apache Spark, this tutorial might address new challenges associated with accessing data in the cloud.\n\nPartner Connect provides optimized, easy-to-configure integrations to many enterprise solutions. See [What is Databricks Partner Connect?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/partner-connect/index.html).\n\n## What data formats can you use in Azure Databricks?\n\nAzure Databricks has built-in keyword bindings for all the data formats natively supported by Apache Spark. Azure Databricks uses Delta Lake as the default protocol for reading and writing data and tables, whereas Apache Spark uses Parquet.\n\nThe following data formats all have built-in keyword configurations in Apache Spark DataFrames and SQL:\n\n* [Delta Lake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/index.html)\n* [Delta Sharing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/deltasharing.html)\n* [Parquet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/parquet.html)\n* [ORC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/orc.html)\n* [JSON](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/json.html)\n* [CSV](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/csv.html)\n* [Avro](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/avro.html)\n* [Text](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/text.html)\n* [Binary](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/binary.html)\n\nAzure Databricks also provides a custom keyword for loading [MLflow experiments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/mlflow-experiment.html).\n\n## Work with streaming data sources on Azure Databricks\n\nAzure Databricks can integrate with stream messaging services for near-real time data ingestion into the Databricks Lakehouse. Azure Databricks can also sync enriched and transformed data in the lakehouse with other streaming systems.\n\nStructured Streaming provides native streaming access to file formats supported by Apache Spark, but Databricks recommends Auto Loader for most Structured Streaming operations that read data from cloud object storage. See [What is Auto Loader?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/ingestion/auto-loader/index.html).\n\nIngesting streaming messages to Delta Lake allows you to retain messages indefinitely, allowing you to replay data streams without fear of losing data due to retention thresholds.\n\nAzure Databricks has specific features for working with semi-structured data fields contained in Avro, protocol buffers, and JSON data payloads. To learn more, see:\n\n* [Transform Avro payload](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/avro-dataframe.html)\n* [Protocol buffers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/protocol-buffers.html)\n\nTo learn more about specific configurations for streaming from or to message queues, see:\n\n* [Kafka](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/kafka.html)\n* [Event Hubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/streaming-event-hubs.html)\n* [Azure Synapse with Structured Streaming](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/synapse.html)\n* [Pub/Sub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/pub-sub.html)\n\n## What data sources connect to Azure Databricks with JDBC?\n\nYou can use [JDBC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/jdbc.html) to connect with many data sources. Databricks Runtime includes drivers for a number of JDBC databases, but you might need to install a driver or different driver version to connect to your preferred database. Supported databases include the following:\n\n* [Query PostgreSQL with Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/postgresql.html)\n* [Query MySQL with Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/mysql.html)\n* [Query MariaDB with Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/mariadb.html)\n* [Query SQL Server with Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/sql-server.html)\n* [Use the Databricks connector to connect to another Databricks workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/databricks.html)\n\nYou may prefer Lakehouse Federation for managing queries to external database systems. See [Run queries using Lakehouse Federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/query-federation/index.html).\n\n## What data services does Azure Databricks integrate with?\n\nThe following data services require you to configure connection settings, security credentials, and networking settings. You might need administrator or power user privileges in your Azure account or Azure Databricks workspace. Some also require that you create an Azure Databricks [library](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/libraries/index.html) and install it in a cluster:\n\n* [Query data in Azure Synapse Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/synapse-analytics.html)\n* [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/cosmosdb-connector.html)\n* [MongoDB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/mongodb.html)\n* [Cassandra](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/cassandra.html)\n* [Couchbase](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/couchbase.html)\n* [ElasticSearch](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/elasticsearch.html)\n* [Read and write data from Snowflake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/snowflake.html)\n* [Google BigQuery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/bigquery.html)\n\nYou may prefer Lakehouse Federation for managing queries to external database systems. See [Run queries using Lakehouse Federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/query-federation/index.html).\n\n### Data formats with special considerations\n\nThe following data formats may require additional configuration or special considerations for use:\n\n* Databricks recommends loading [images](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/image.html) as `binary` data.\n* [XML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/xml.html) is not natively supported, but can be used after installing a library.\n* [Hive tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/hive-tables.html) are also natively supported by Apache Spark, but require configuration on Azure Databricks.\n* Azure Databricks can directly read many file formats while still compressed. You can also [unzip compressed files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/files/unzip-files.html) on Azure Databricks if necessary.\n* [LZO](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/lzo.html) requires a codec installation.\n\nFor more information about Apache Spark data sources, see [Generic Load/Save Functions](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-load-save-functions.html) and [Generic File Source Options](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-generic-options.html).\n""

It can help you rapidly answer questions by generating, optimizing, completing, explaining, and fixing code and queries.\n\nThis page provides general information about the Assistant in the form of frequently asked questions. For questions about privacy and security, see [Privacy and security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/databricks-assistant-faq#privacy-security).\n\n### Q: How do I enable Databricks Assistant?\n\nAn account administrator must enable Databricks Assistant as follows:\n\n1. As an account admin, log in to the [Account Console](https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net/login/).\n\nImportant\n\nIf no users in your Azure Active Directory tenant have yet logged in to the account console, you or another user in your tenant must log in as the first account admin. To do this, you must be an Azure Active Directory Global Administrator, but only when you first log in to the Azure Databricks [Account Console](https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net/login/). Upon first login, you become an Azure Databricks account admin and no longer need the Azure Active Directory Global Administrator role to access the Azure Databricks account. As the first account admin, you can assign users in the Azure Active Directory tenant as additional account admins (who can themselves assign more account admins). Additional account admins do not require specific roles in Azure Active Directory. See [Manage users, service principals, and groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/index.html).\n2. Click **Settings** ![Settings icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/settings-icon.png).\n3. Click the **Feature enablement** tab.\n4. Toggle **Enable third party services for AI assistive features** to **Enable for all**.\n\n### Q: How do I use Databricks Assistant?\n\nTo access Databricks Assistant, click the Assistant icon ![Databricks assistant icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/assistant-icon.png) in the left sidebar of the notebook, the file editor, or the SQL Editor.\n\n![Databricks assistant icon location](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/assistant-icon-in-sidebar.png)\n\nThe Assistant panel opens in the left side of the screen.\n\n![Databricks assistant panel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/assistant-panel.png)\n\nSome capabilities of Databricks Assistant are the following:\n\n* Complete: [Keyboard shortcuts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/databricks-assistant-examples.html#assistant-code-complete) are available in a notebook cell or in the query editor to have Databricks Assistant autocomplete your code.\n* Generate: Use natural language to generate a SQL query.\n* Explain: Highlight a query or a block of code and have Databricks Assistant walk through the logic in clear, concise English.\n* Fix: Explain and fix syntax and runtime errors with a single click.\n* Transform and optimize: Convert Pandas code to PySpark for faster execution.\n\nFor some example tasks you can try, see [Databricks Assistant: sample tasks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/databricks-assistant-examples.html).\n\n### Q: What services does the Databricks Assistant use?\n\nDatabricks Assistant may use third-party services to provide responses, including [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/) and the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies). These services are subject to their respective data management policies. Data sent to these services is automatically purged within 30 days, and is not used for any model training. For Azure OpenAI, Azure Databricks has opted out of [Abuse Monitoring](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext#preventing-abuse-and-harmful-content-generation) so no prompts or responses are stored with Azure OpenAI. For details, see [Azure data management policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy) and [OpenAI API data usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies).\n\n### Q: What is the difference between OpenAI API, and Azure OpenAI Service?\n\nDatabricks Assistant uses the [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cognitive-services/openai-service), which means that all data sent to the service is managed under the Azure terms and subscription. The [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies) is operated directly by OpenAI rather than by Microsoft.\n\n### Q: Are there tips for improving the accuracy of returned results?\n\n* Be as specific as possible. Specify tables and examples of what the data looks like.\n* Databricks Assistant knows about your table and column schema and metadata. This allows you to use natural language and generate fairly accurate queries. For example, if your table has columns `userID` and `State`, you can ask Databricks Assistant to generate a list of users who live in Washington.\n* Databricks Assistant has access only to table and column metadata and does not have access to row level data. Thus, it may not write queries correctly if the actual data has unique shapes. For example, if you have a column `Price`, and each value appends a country denomination (for example, $10.99 USD, $5.99 CAD) the returned query may have trouble summing that column since it’s not a DECIMAL. Try to provide specific instructions to Databricks Assistant for parsing that column. For example: “Sum the total revenue from crackers. Price is a string column that has a country denomination appended to each currency value like ‘$10.99 USD’”.\n\nDatabricks Assistant considers the history of the conversation so you can refine your questions as you go.\n\n### Q: How do I give feedback?\n\nThe best way to send feedback is to use the “Provide Feedback” links in the notebook and SQL editor. You can also send an email to REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@databricks.com` or to your account team.\n\nWe’re primarily interested in hearing about product improvement suggestions and user experience issues rather than prompt accuracy. If you receive an unhelpful suggestion from the Assistant, click the “Not useful” thumbs down button to let us capture that feedback.\n\n## Privacy and security\n\n### Q: What data is being sent to the models?\n\nDatabricks Assistant sends code and metadata to the models on each API request. This helps return more relevant results for your data. Examples include:\n\n* Code/queries in the current notebook cell or SQL Editor tab\n* Table and Column names and descriptions\n* Previous questions\n* Favorite tables\n\n### Q: If I execute a query with results, and then ask a question, do the results of my query get sent to the model?\n\nNo, only the code contents in cells, metadata about tables, and the user-entered text is shared with the model. For the “fix error” feature, Databricks also shares the stack trace from the error output.\n\n### Q: Will Databricks Assistant execute dangerous code?\n\nNo. Databricks Assistant does not automatically execute code on your behalf. AI models can make mistakes, misunderstand intent, and hallucinate or give incorrect answers. Be sure to review AI generated code prior to executing it.\n']",['https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/databricks-assistant-faq'],"[

Click **Settings** ![Settings icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/settings-icon.png).\n3. Click the **Feature enablement** tab.\n4. Toggle **Enable third party services for AI assistive features** to **Enable for all**.\n\n### Q: How do I use Databricks Assistant?\n\nTo access Databricks Assistant, click the Assistant icon ![Databricks assistant icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/assistant-icon.png) in the left sidebar of the notebook, the file editor, or the SQL Editor.\n\n![Databricks assistant icon location](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/assistant-icon-in-sidebar.png)\n\nThe Assistant panel opens in the left side of the screen.\n\n![Databricks assistant panel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/assistant-panel.png)\n\nSome capabilities of Databricks Assistant are the following:\n\n* Complete: [Keyboard shortcuts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/databricks-assistant-examples.html#assistant-code-complete) are available in a notebook cell or in the query editor to have Databricks Assistant autocomplete your code.\n* Generate: Use natural language to generate a SQL query.\n* Explain: Highlight a query or a block of code and have Databricks Assistant walk through the logic in clear, concise English.\n* Fix: Explain and fix syntax and runtime errors with a single click.\n* Transform and optimize: Convert Pandas code to PySpark for faster execution.\n\nFor some example tasks you can try, see [Databricks Assistant: sample tasks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/databricks-assistant-examples.html).\n\n### Q: What services does the Databricks Assistant use?\n\nDatabricks Assistant may use third-party services to provide responses, including [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/) and the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies). These services are subject to their respective data management policies. Data sent to these services is automatically purged within 30 days, and is not used for any model training. For Azure OpenAI, Azure Databricks has opted out of [Abuse Monitoring](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext#preventing-abuse-and-harmful-content-generation) so no prompts or responses are stored with Azure OpenAI. For details, see [Azure data management policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy) and [OpenAI API data usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies).\n\n### Q: What is the difference between OpenAI API, and Azure OpenAI Service?\n\nDatabricks Assistant uses the [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cognitive-services/openai-service), which means that all data sent to the service is managed under the Azure terms and subscription. The [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies) is operated directly by OpenAI rather than by Microsoft.\n\n### Q: Are there tips for improving the accuracy of returned results?\n\n* Be as specific as possible. Specify tables and examples of what the data looks like.\n* Databricks Assistant knows about your table and column schema and metadata. This allows you to use natural language and generate fairly accurate queries. For example, if your table has columns `userID` and `State`, you can ask Databricks Assistant to generate a list of users who live in Washington.\n* Databricks Assistant has access only to table and column metadata and does not have access to row level data. Thus, it may not write queries correctly if the actual data has unique shapes. For example, if you have a column `Price`, and each value appends a country denomination (for example, $10.99 USD, $5.99 CAD) the returned query may have trouble summing that column since it\u2019s not a DECIMAL. Try to provide specific instructions to Databricks Assistant for parsing that column. For example: \u201cSum the total revenue from crackers. Price is a string column that has a country denomination appended to each currency value like \u2018$10.99 USD\u2019\u201d.\n\nDatabricks Assistant considers the history of the conversation so you can refine your questions as you go.\n\n### Q: How do I give feedback?\n\nThe best way to send feedback is to use the \u201cProvide Feedback\u201d links in the notebook and SQL editor. You can also send an email to REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@databricks.com` or to your account team.\n\nWe\u2019re primarily interested in hearing about product improvement suggestions and user experience issues rather than prompt accuracy. If you receive an unhelpful suggestion from the Assistant, click the \u201cNot useful\u201d thumbs down button to let us capture that feedback.\n\n## Privacy and security\n\n### Q: What data is being sent to the models?\n\nDatabricks Assistant sends code and metadata to the models on each API request. This helps return more relevant results for your data. Examples include:\n\n* Code/queries in the current notebook cell or SQL Editor tab\n* Table and Column names and descriptions\n* Previous questions\n* Favorite tables\n\n### Q: If I execute a query with results, and then ask a question, do the results of my query get sent to the model?\n\nNo, only the code contents in cells, metadata about tables, and the user-entered text is shared with the model. For the \u201cfix error\u201d feature, Databricks also shares the stack trace from the error output.\n\n### Q: Will Databricks Assistant execute dangerous code?\n\nNo. Databricks Assistant does not automatically execute code on your behalf. AI models can make mistakes, misunderstand intent, and hallucinate or give incorrect answers. Be sure to review AI generated code prior to executing it.\n\n````\n\nProvided context:\n - \n The user is viewing a page titled \""Admin Settings - Databricks\"" in the Databricks product.

                    ""content"": ""# Databricks Assistant FAQ\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is currently in [Public Preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/release-notes/release-types.html). Usage of the feature during the preview is free. Final pricing will be established and communicated prior to general availability (GA).\n\n## What is Databricks Assistant?\n\nDatabricks Assistant works as an AI-based companion pair-programmer to make you more efficient as you create notebooks, queries, and files. It can help you rapidly answer questions by generating, optimizing, completing, explaining, and fixing code and queries.\n\nThis page provides general information about the Assistant in the form of frequently asked questions. For questions about privacy and security, see [Privacy and security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/databricks-assistant-faq#privacy-security).\n\n### Q: How do I enable Databricks Assistant?\n\nAn account administrator must enable Databricks Assistant as follows:\n\n1. As an account admin, log in to the [Account Console](https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net/login/).\n\nImportant\n\nIf no users in your Azure Active Directory tenant have yet logged in to the account console, you or another user in your tenant must log in as the first account admin. To do this, you must be an Azure Active Directory Global Administrator, but only when you first log in to the Azure Databricks [Account Console](https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net/login/). Upon first login, you become an Azure Databricks account admin and no longer need the Azure Active Directory Global Administrator role to access the Azure Databricks account. As the first account admin, you can assign users in the Azure Active Directory tenant as additional account admins (who can themselves assign more account admins). Additional account admins do not require specific roles in Azure Active Directory. See [Manage users, service principals, and groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/index.html).\n2. Click **Settings** ![Settings icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/settings-icon.png).\n3. Click the **Feature enablement** tab.\n4. Toggle **Enable third party services for AI assistive features** to **Enable for all**.\n\n### Q: How do I use Databricks Assistant?\n\nTo access Databricks Assistant, click the Assistant icon ![Databricks assistant icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/assistant-icon.png) in the left sidebar of the notebook, the file editor, or the SQL Editor.\n\n![Databricks assistant icon location](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/assistant-icon-in-sidebar.png)\n\nThe Assistant panel opens in the left side of the screen.\n\n![Databricks assistant panel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/assistant-panel.png)\n\nSome capabilities of Databricks Assistant are the following:\n\n* Complete: [Keyboard shortcuts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/databricks-assistant-examples.html#assistant-code-complete) are available in a notebook cell or in the query editor to have Databricks Assistant autocomplete your code.\n* Generate: Use natural language to generate a SQL query.\n* Explain: Highlight a query or a block of code and have Databricks Assistant walk through the logic in clear, concise English.\n* Fix: Explain and fix syntax and runtime errors with a single click.\n* Transform and optimize: Convert Pandas code to PySpark for faster execution.\n\nFor some example tasks you can try, see [Databricks Assistant: sample tasks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/databricks-assistant-examples.html).\n\n### Q: What services does the Databricks Assistant use?\n\nDatabricks Assistant may use third-party services to provide responses, including [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/) and the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies). These services are subject to their respective data management policies. Data sent to these services is automatically purged within 30 days, and is not used for any model training. For Azure OpenAI, Azure Databricks has opted out of [Abuse Monitoring](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext#preventing-abuse-and-harmful-content-generation) so no prompts or responses are stored with Azure OpenAI. For details, see [Azure data management policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy) and [OpenAI API data usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies).\n\n### Q: What is the difference between OpenAI API, and Azure OpenAI Service?\n\nDatabricks Assistant uses the [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cognitive-services/openai-service), which means that all data sent to the service is managed under the Azure terms and subscription. The [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies) is operated directly by OpenAI rather than by Microsoft.\n\n### Q: Are there tips for improving the accuracy of returned results?\n\n* Be as specific as possible. Specify tables and examples of what the data looks like.\n* Databricks Assistant knows about your table and column schema and metadata. This allows you to use natural language and generate fairly accurate queries. For example, if your table has columns `userID` and `State`, you can ask Databricks Assistant to generate a list of users who live in Washington.\n* Databricks Assistant has access only to table and column metadata and does not have access to row level data. Thus, it may not write queries correctly if the actual data has unique shapes. For example, if you have a column `Price`, and each value appends a country denomination (for example, $10.99 USD, $5.99 CAD) the returned query may have trouble summing that column since it\u2019s not a DECIMAL. Try to provide specific instructions to Databricks Assistant for parsing that column. For example: \u201cSum the total revenue from crackers. Price is a string column that has a country denomination appended to each currency value like \u2018$10.99 USD\u2019\u201d.\n\nDatabricks Assistant considers the history of the conversation so you can refine your questions as you go.\n\n### Q: How do I give feedback?\n\nThe best way to send feedback is to use the \u201cProvide Feedback\u201d links in the notebook and SQL editor. You can also send an email to REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@databricks.com` or to your account team.\n\nWe\u2019re primarily interested in hearing about product improvement suggestions and user experience issues rather than prompt accuracy. If you receive an unhelpful suggestion from the Assistant, click the \u201cNot useful\u201d thumbs down button to let us capture that feedback.\n\n## Privacy and security\n\n### Q: What data is being sent to the models?\n\nDatabricks Assistant sends code and metadata to the models on each API request. This helps return more relevant results for your data. Examples include:\n\n* Code/queries in the current notebook cell or SQL Editor tab\n* Table and Column names and descriptions\n* Previous questions\n* Favorite tables\n\n### Q: If I execute a query with results, and then ask a question, do the results of my query get sent to the model?\n\nNo, only the code contents in cells, metadata about tables, and the user-entered text is shared with the model. For the \u201cfix error\u201d feature, Databricks also shares the stack trace from the error output.\n\n### Q: Will Databricks Assistant execute dangerous code?\n\nNo. Databricks Assistant does not automatically execute code on your behalf. AI models can make mistakes, misunderstand intent, and hallucinate or give incorrect answers. Be sure to review AI generated code prior to executing it.\n""

Usage of the feature during the preview is free. Final pricing will be established and communicated prior to general availability (GA).\n\n## What is Databricks Assistant?\n\nDatabricks Assistant works as an AI-based companion pair-programmer to make you more efficient as you create notebooks, queries, and files. It can help you rapidly answer questions by generating, optimizing, completing, explaining, and fixing code and queries.\n\nThis page provides general information about the Assistant in the form of frequently asked questions. For questions about privacy and security, see [Privacy and security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/databricks-assistant-faq#privacy-security).\n\n### Q: How do I enable Databricks Assistant?\n\nAn account administrator must enable Databricks Assistant as follows:\n\n1. As an account admin, log in to the [Account Console](https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net/login/).\n\nImportant\n\nIf no users in your Azure Active Directory tenant have yet logged in to the account console, you or another user in your tenant must log in as the first account admin. To do this, you must be an Azure Active Directory Global Administrator, but only when you first log in to the Azure Databricks [Account Console](https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net/login/). Upon first login, you become an Azure Databricks account admin and no longer need the Azure Active Directory Global Administrator role to access the Azure Databricks account. As the first account admin, you can assign users in the Azure Active Directory tenant as additional account admins (who can themselves assign more account admins). Additional account admins do not require specific roles in Azure Active Directory. See [Manage users, service principals, and groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/index.html).\n2. Click **Settings** ![Settings icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/settings-icon.png).\n3. Click the **Feature enablement** tab.\n4. Toggle **Enable third party services for AI assistive features** to **Enable for all**.\n\n### Q: How do I use Databricks Assistant?\n\nTo access Databricks Assistant, click the Assistant icon ![Databricks assistant icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/assistant-icon.png) in the left sidebar of the notebook, the file editor, or the SQL Editor.\n\n![Databricks assistant icon location](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/assistant-icon-in-sidebar.png)\n\nThe Assistant panel opens in the left side of the screen.\n\n![Databricks assistant panel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/assistant-panel.png)\n\nSome capabilities of Databricks Assistant are the following:\n\n* Complete: [Keyboard shortcuts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/databricks-assistant-examples.html#assistant-code-complete) are available in a notebook cell or in the query editor to have Databricks Assistant autocomplete your code.\n* Generate: Use natural language to generate a SQL query.\n* Explain: Highlight a query or a block of code and have Databricks Assistant walk through the logic in clear, concise English.\n* Fix: Explain and fix syntax and runtime errors with a single click.\n* Transform and optimize: Convert Pandas code to PySpark for faster execution.\n\nFor some example tasks you can try, see [Databricks Assistant: sample tasks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/databricks-assistant-examples.html).\n\n### Q: What services does the Databricks Assistant use?\n\nDatabricks Assistant may use third-party services to provide responses, including [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/) and the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies). These services are subject to their respective data management policies. Data sent to these services is automatically purged within 30 days, and is not used for any model training. For Azure OpenAI, Azure Databricks has opted out of [Abuse Monitoring](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fopenai%2Fcontext%2Fcontext#preventing-abuse-and-harmful-content-generation) so no prompts or responses are stored with Azure OpenAI. For details, see [Azure data management policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy) and [OpenAI API data usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies).\n\n### Q: What is the difference between OpenAI API, and Azure OpenAI Service?\n\nDatabricks Assistant uses the [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cognitive-services/openai-service), which means that all data sent to the service is managed under the Azure terms and subscription. The [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies) is operated directly by OpenAI rather than by Microsoft.\n\n### Q: Are there tips for improving the accuracy of returned results?\n\n* Be as specific as possible. Specify tables and examples of what the data looks like.\n* Databricks Assistant knows about your table and column schema and metadata. This allows you to use natural language and generate fairly accurate queries. For example, if your table has columns `userID` and `State`, you can ask Databricks Assistant to generate a list of users who live in Washington.\n* Databricks Assistant has access only to table and column metadata and does not have access to row level data. Thus, it may not write queries correctly if the actual data has unique shapes.

Price is a string column that has a country denomination appended to each currency value like \u2018$10.99 USD\u2019\u201d.\n\nDatabricks Assistant considers the history of the conversation so you can refine your questions as you go.\n\n### Q: How do I give feedback?\n\nThe best way to send feedback is to use the \u201cProvide Feedback\u201d links in the notebook and SQL editor.

You can also publish Power BI reports to the Power BI service and enable users to access the underlying Azure Databricks data using single sign-on (SSO), passing along the same Azure Active Directory credentials they use to access the report.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Power BI Desktop 2.85.681.0 or above. [Download the latest version](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=58494). To use data managed by Unity Catalog with Power BI, you must use Power BI Desktop 2.98.683.0 or above (October 2021 release).\n\nNote\n\nPower BI Desktop requires Windows. An alternative for other operating systems is to run Power BI Desktop on a physical host or a Windows-based virtual machine and then connect to it from your operating system.\n\nIf you use a version of Power BI Desktop below 2.85.681.0, you also need to install the [Databricks ODBC driver](https://databricks.com/spark/odbc-drivers-download) in the same environment as Power BI Desktop.\n\n* An Azure Databricks [personal access token](https://docs.databricks.com/api/azure/workspace/tokenmanagement) or your Azure Active Directory account credentials.\n\nNote\n\nAs a security best practice, when you authenticate with automated tools, systems, scripts, and apps, Databricks recommends that you use personal access tokens belonging to [service principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html) instead of workspace users. To create tokens for service principals, see [Manage tokens for a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html#personal-access-tokens).\n\n* An Azure Databricks [cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/clusters/configure.html) or Databricks SQL [warehouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/admin/create-sql-warehouse.html).\n\n## Connect Power BI Desktop to Azure Databricks using Partner Connect\n\nYou can use Partner Connect to connect to a cluster or SQL warehouse from Power BI Desktop in just a few clicks.\n\n1. Make sure your Azure Databricks account, workspace, and the signed-in user meet the [requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/partner-connect/index.html#requirements) for Partner Connect.\n\n2. In the sidebar, click ![Partner Connect button](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/partner-connect.png) **Partner Connect**.\n\n3. Click the **Power BI** tile.\n\n4. In the **Connect to partner** dialog, for **Compute**, choose the name of the Azure Databricks compute resource that you want to connect.\n\n5. Choose **Download connection file**.\n\n6. Open the downloaded connection file, which starts Power BI Desktop.\n\n7. In Power BI Desktop, enter your authentication credentials:\n\n   * **Personal Access Token**: Enter your Azure Databricks personal access token.\n   * **Azure Active Directory**: Click **Sign in** and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n   * **Username / Password**: Not applicable.\n\n8. Click **Connect**.\n\n9. Select the Azure Databricks data to query from the Power BI **Navigator**.\n\n![Power BI Navigator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/power-bi-navigator.png)\n\n## Connect Power BI Desktop to Azure Databricks manually\n\nFollow these instructions, depending on your chosen authentication method, to connect to a cluster or SQL warehouse with Power BI Desktop.\n\nNote\n\nTo connect faster with Power BI Desktop, use Partner Connect.\n\n1. Get the [Server Hostname and HTTP Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/integrations/jdbc-odbc-bi.html#get-server-hostname-port-http-path-and-jdbc-url).\n\n2. Start Power BI Desktop.\n\n3. Click **Get data** or **File > Get data**.\n\n4. Click **Get data to get started**.\n\n5. Search for **Databricks**, then click the connector:\n\n   * **Azure Databricks**\n\n6. Click **Connect**.\n\n7. Enter the **Server Hostname** and **HTTP Path**.\n\n8. Select your **Data Connectivity mode**. For information about the difference between **Import** and **DirectQuery**, see [Use DirectQuery in Power BI Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-use-directquery).\n\n9. Click **OK**.\n\n10. Click your authentication method:\n\n    * **Personal Access Token**: Enter your Azure Databricks personal access token.\n    * **Azure Active Directory**: Click **Sign in** and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n    * **Username / Password**: Not applicable.\n\n11. Click **Connect**.\n\n12. Select the Azure Databricks data to query from the Power BI **Navigator**. If Unity Catalog is enabled for your workspace, select a catalog before you select a schema and a table.\n\n![Power BI Navigator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/power-bi-navigator.png)\n\n## Using a custom SQL query\n\nThe Databricks connector provides the `Databricks.Query` data source that allows a user to provide a custom SQL query.\n\n1. Follow the steps described in [Connect with Power BI Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/partners/bi/power-bi#manual-connection) to create a connection, using **Import** as the data connectivity mode.\n2. In the **Navigator**, right click the top-most item containing the selected host name and HTTP path and click **Transform Data** to open the Power Query Editor.\n\n![Click Transform Data in the Navigator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/power-bi-navigator-transform-data-source.png)\n3. In the function bar, replace the function name `Databricks.Catalogs` with `Databricks.Query` and apply the change. This creates a Power Query function that takes a SQL query as parameter.\n4. Enter the desired SQL query in the parameter field and click **Invoke**. This executes the query and a new table is created with the query results as its contents.\n\n## Access Azure Databricks data source using the Power BI service\n\nWhen you publish a report to the Power BI service, you connect to Azure Databricks using a personal access token. In the Power BI service, you can also enable single sign on (SSO) so that users can access reports built using DirectQuery storage mode by passing their Azure Active Directory credentials to Azure Databricks.\n\n1. Publish your Power BI report from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI service.\n\n2. Enable single sign on (SSO) access to the report and underlying data source.\n\n   1. Go to the underlying Azure Databricks dataset for the report in the Power BI service, expand **Data source credentials**, and click **Edit credentials**.\n   2. On the configuration dialog, select **Report viewers can only access this data source with their own Power BI identities using Direct Query** and click **Sign in**.\n      ![Enable SSO for Databricks data access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/enable-sso.png)\n\nWith this option selected, access to the data source is handled using DirectQuery and managed using the Azure AD identity of the user who is accessing the report. If you don’t select this option, only you, as the user who published the report, have access to the Azure Databricks data source.\n\n## Automated HTTP proxy detection\n\nPower BI Desktop version 2.104.941.0 and above (May 2022 release) has built-in support for detecting Windows system-wide HTTP proxy configuration. [Download the latest version](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=58494).\n\nPower BI Desktop can automatically detect and use your Windows system-wide HTTP proxy configuration.\n\nIf the proxy server does not provide a CRL distribution point (CDP), Power BI might show the following error message:\n\n```\nDetails: ""ODBC: ERROR [HY000] [Microsoft][DriverSupport] (1200)\n-The revocation status of the certificate or one of the certificates in the certificate chain is unknown.""\n\n```\n\nTo fix this error, complete the following steps:\n\n1. Create the file `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Power BI Desktop\\bin\\ODBC Drivers\\Simba Spark ODBC Driver\\microsoft.sparkodbc.ini` if it does not exist.\n2. Add the following config to your `microsoft.sparkodbc.ini` file:\n\n```\n[Driver]\nCheckCertRevocation=0\n\n```\n\n## Power BI Delta Sharing connector\n\nThe Power BI Delta Sharing connector allows users to discover, analyze, and visualize datasets shared with them through the [Delta Sharing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-sharing/index.html) open protocol. The protocol enables secure exchange of datasets across products and platforms by leveraging REST and cloud storage.\n\nFor connection instructions, see [Power BI: Read shared data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-sharing/read-data-open.html#power-bi).\n\n## Limitations\n\n* The Azure Databricks connector supports [web proxy](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-troubleshooting-sign-in#using-default-system-credentials-for-web-proxy). However, automatic proxy settings defined in .pac files aren’t supported.\n* In the Azure Databricks connector, the `Databricks.Query` data source is not supported in combination with DirectQuery mode.\n* The data that the Delta Sharing connector loads must fit into the memory of your machine. To ensure this, the connector limits the number of imported rows to the **Row Limit** that was set earlier.\n\n## Additional resources\n\n[Support](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/support/)\n']",['https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/partners/bi/power-bi'],"[

                    ""content"": ""# Connect Power BI to Azure Databricks\n\n[Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) is a business analytics service that provides interactive visualizations with self-service business intelligence capabilities, enabling end users to create reports and dashboards by themselves without having to depend on information technology staff or database administrators.\n\nWhen you use Azure Databricks as a data source with Power BI, you can bring the advantages of Azure Databricks performance and technology beyond data scientists and data engineers to all business users.\n\nYou can connect Power BI Desktop to your Azure Databricks clusters and Databricks SQL warehouses. You can also publish Power BI reports to the Power BI service and enable users to access the underlying Azure Databricks data using single sign-on (SSO), passing along the same Azure Active Directory credentials they use to access the report.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Power BI Desktop 2.85.681.0 or above. [Download the latest version](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=58494). To use data managed by Unity Catalog with Power BI, you must use Power BI Desktop 2.98.683.0 or above (October 2021 release).\n\nNote\n\nPower BI Desktop requires Windows. An alternative for other operating systems is to run Power BI Desktop on a physical host or a Windows-based virtual machine and then connect to it from your operating system.\n\nIf you use a version of Power BI Desktop below 2.85.681.0, you also need to install the [Databricks ODBC driver](https://databricks.com/spark/odbc-drivers-download) in the same environment as Power BI Desktop.\n\n* An Azure Databricks [personal access token](https://docs.databricks.com/api/azure/workspace/tokenmanagement) or your Azure Active Directory account credentials.\n\nNote\n\nAs a security best practice, when you authenticate with automated tools, systems, scripts, and apps, Databricks recommends that you use personal access tokens belonging to [service principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html) instead of workspace users. To create tokens for service principals, see [Manage tokens for a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html#personal-access-tokens).\n\n* An Azure Databricks [cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/clusters/configure.html) or Databricks SQL [warehouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/admin/create-sql-warehouse.html).\n\n## Connect Power BI Desktop to Azure Databricks using Partner Connect\n\nYou can use Partner Connect to connect to a cluster or SQL warehouse from Power BI Desktop in just a few clicks.\n\n1. Make sure your Azure Databricks account, workspace, and the signed-in user meet the [requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/partner-connect/index.html#requirements) for Partner Connect.\n\n2. In the sidebar, click ![Partner Connect button](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/partner-connect.png) **Partner Connect**.\n\n3. Click the **Power BI** tile.\n\n4. In the **Connect to partner** dialog, for **Compute**, choose the name of the Azure Databricks compute resource that you want to connect.\n\n5. Choose **Download connection file**.\n\n6. Open the downloaded connection file, which starts Power BI Desktop.\n\n7. In Power BI Desktop, enter your authentication credentials:\n\n   * **Personal Access Token**: Enter your Azure Databricks personal access token.\n   * **Azure Active Directory**: Click **Sign in** and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n   * **Username / Password**: Not applicable.\n\n8. Click **Connect**.\n\n9. Select the Azure Databricks data to query from the Power BI **Navigator**.\n\n![Power BI Navigator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/power-bi-navigator.png)\n\n## Connect Power BI Desktop to Azure Databricks manually\n\nFollow these instructions, depending on your chosen authentication method, to connect to a cluster or SQL warehouse with Power BI Desktop.\n\nNote\n\nTo connect faster with Power BI Desktop, use Partner Connect.\n\n1. Get the [Server Hostname and HTTP Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/integrations/jdbc-odbc-bi.html#get-server-hostname-port-http-path-and-jdbc-url).\n\n2. Start Power BI Desktop.\n\n3. Click **Get data** or **File > Get data**.\n\n4. Click **Get data to get started**.\n\n5. Search for **Databricks**, then click the connector:\n\n   * **Azure Databricks**\n\n6. Click **Connect**.\n\n7. Enter the **Server Hostname** and **HTTP Path**.\n\n8. Select your **Data Connectivity mode**. For information about the difference between **Import** and **DirectQuery**, see [Use DirectQuery in Power BI Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-use-directquery).\n\n9. Click **OK**.\n\n10. Click your authentication method:\n\n    * **Personal Access Token**: Enter your Azure Databricks personal access token.\n    * **Azure Active Directory**: Click **Sign in** and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n    * **Username / Password**: Not applicable.\n\n11. Click **Connect**.\n\n12. Select the Azure Databricks data to query from the Power BI **Navigator**. If Unity Catalog is enabled for your workspace, select a catalog before you select a schema and a table.\n\n![Power BI Navigator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/power-bi-navigator.png)\n\n## Using a custom SQL query\n\nThe Databricks connector provides the `Databricks.Query` data source that allows a user to provide a custom SQL query.\n\n1. Follow the steps described in [Connect with Power BI Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/partners/bi/power-bi#manual-connection) to create a connection, using **Import** as the data connectivity mode.\n2. In the **Navigator**, right click the top-most item containing the selected host name and HTTP path and click **Transform Data** to open the Power Query Editor.\n\n![Click Transform Data in the Navigator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/power-bi-navigator-transform-data-source.png)\n3. In the function bar, replace the function name `Databricks.Catalogs` with `Databricks.Query` and apply the change. This creates a Power Query function that takes a SQL query as parameter.\n4. Enter the desired SQL query in the parameter field and click **Invoke**. This executes the query and a new table is created with the query results as its contents.\n\n## Access Azure Databricks data source using the Power BI service\n\nWhen you publish a report to the Power BI service, you connect to Azure Databricks using a personal access token. In the Power BI service, you can also enable single sign on (SSO) so that users can access reports built using DirectQuery storage mode by passing their Azure Active Directory credentials to Azure Databricks.\n\n1. Publish your Power BI report from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI service.\n\n2. Enable single sign on (SSO) access to the report and underlying data source.\n\n   1. Go to the underlying Azure Databricks dataset for the report in the Power BI service, expand **Data source credentials**, and click **Edit credentials**.\n   2. On the configuration dialog, select **Report viewers can only access this data source with their own Power BI identities using Direct Query** and click **Sign in**.\n      ![Enable SSO for Databricks data access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/enable-sso.png)\n\nWith this option selected, access to the data source is handled using DirectQuery and managed using the Azure AD identity of the user who is accessing the report. If you don\u2019t select this option, only you, as the user who published the report, have access to the Azure Databricks data source.\n\n## Automated HTTP proxy detection\n\nPower BI Desktop version 2.104.941.0 and above (May 2022 release) has built-in support for detecting Windows system-wide HTTP proxy configuration. [Download the latest version](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=58494).\n\nPower BI Desktop can automatically detect and use your Windows system-wide HTTP proxy configuration.\n\nIf the proxy server does not provide a CRL distribution point (CDP), Power BI might show the following error message:\n\n```\nDetails: \""ODBC: ERROR [HY000] [Microsoft][DriverSupport] (1200)\n-The revocation status of the certificate or one of the certificates in the certificate chain is unknown.\""\n\n```\n\nTo fix this error, complete the following steps:\n\n1. Create the file `C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Power BI Desktop\\bin\\ODBC Drivers\\Simba Spark ODBC Driver\\microsoft.sparkodbc.ini` if it does not exist.\n2. Add the following config to your `microsoft.sparkodbc.ini` file:\n\n```\n[Driver]\nCheckCertRevocation=0\n\n```\n\n## Power BI Delta Sharing connector\n\nThe Power BI Delta Sharing connector allows users to discover, analyze, and visualize datasets shared with them through the [Delta Sharing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-sharing/index.html) open protocol. The protocol enables secure exchange of datasets across products and platforms by leveraging REST and cloud storage.\n\nFor connection instructions, see [Power BI: Read shared data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-sharing/read-data-open.html#power-bi).\n\n## Limitations\n\n* The Azure Databricks connector supports [web proxy](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-troubleshooting-sign-in#using-default-system-credentials-for-web-proxy). However, automatic proxy settings defined in .pac files aren\u2019t supported.\n* In the Azure Databricks connector, the `Databricks.Query` data source is not supported in combination with DirectQuery mode.\n* The data that the Delta Sharing connector loads must fit into the memory of your machine. To ensure this, the connector limits the number of imported rows to the **Row Limit** that was set earlier.\n\n## Additional resources\n\n[Support](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/support/)\n""

The protocol enables secure exchange of datasets across products and platforms by leveraging REST and cloud storage.\n\nFor connection instructions, see [Power BI: Read shared data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-sharing/read-data-open.html#power-bi).\n\n## Limitations\n\n* The Azure Databricks connector supports [web proxy](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-troubleshooting-sign-in#using-default-system-credentials-for-web-proxy). However, automatic proxy settings defined in .pac files aren\u2019t supported.\n* In the Azure Databricks connector, the `Databricks.Query` data source is not supported in combination with DirectQuery mode.\n* The data that the Delta Sharing connector loads must fit into the memory of your machine. To ensure this, the connector limits the number of imported rows to the **Row Limit** that was set earlier.\n\n## Additional resources\n\n[Support](https://powerbi.microso\n````\n\nProvided context:\n - \n The user is viewing a page titled \""New query*\"" in the Databricks product.

                    ""content"": ""# Connect Power BI to Azure Databricks\n\n[Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) is a business analytics service that provides interactive visualizations with self-service business intelligence capabilities, enabling end users to create reports and dashboards by themselves without having to depend on information technology staff or database administrators.\n\nWhen you use Azure Databricks as a data source with Power BI, you can bring the advantages of Azure Databricks performance and technology beyond data scientists and data engineers to all business users.\n\nYou can connect Power BI Desktop to your Azure Databricks clusters and Databricks SQL warehouses. You can also publish Power BI reports to the Power BI service and enable users to access the underlying Azure Databricks data using single sign-on (SSO), passing along the same Azure Active Directory credentials they use to access the report.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Power BI Desktop 2.85.681.0 or above. [Download the latest version](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=58494). To use data managed by Unity Catalog with Power BI, you must use Power BI Desktop 2.98.683.0 or above (October 2021 release).\n\nNote\n\nPower BI Desktop requires Windows. An alternative for other operating systems is to run Power BI Desktop on a physical host or a Windows-based virtual machine and then connect to it from your operating system.\n\nIf you use a version of Power BI Desktop below 2.85.681.0, you also need to install the [Databricks ODBC driver](https://databricks.com/spark/odbc-drivers-download) in the same environment as Power BI Desktop.\n\n* An Azure Databricks [personal access token](https://docs.databricks.com/api/azure/workspace/tokenmanagement) or your Azure Active Directory account credentials.\n\nNote\n\nAs a security best practice, when you authenticate with automated tools, systems, scripts, and apps, Databricks recommends that you use personal access tokens belonging to [service principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html) instead of workspace users. To create tokens for service principals, see [Manage tokens for a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html#personal-access-tokens).\n\n* An Azure Databricks [cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/clusters/configure.html) or Databricks SQL [warehouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/admin/create-sql-warehouse.html).\n\n## Connect Power BI Desktop to Azure Databricks using Partner Connect\n\nYou can use Partner Connect to connect to a cluster or SQL warehouse from Power BI Desktop in just a few clicks.\n\n1. Make sure your Azure Databricks account, workspace, and the signed-in user meet the [requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/partner-connect/index.html#requirements) for Partner Connect.\n\n2. In the sidebar, click ![Partner Connect button](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/partner-connect.png) **Partner Connect**.\n\n3. Click the **Power BI** tile.\n\n4. In the **Connect to partner** dialog, for **Compute**, choose the name of the Azure Databricks compute resource that you want to connect.\n\n5. Choose **Download connection file**.\n\n6. Open the downloaded connection file, which starts Power BI Desktop.\n\n7. In Power BI Desktop, enter your authentication credentials:\n\n   * **Personal Access Token**: Enter your Azure Databricks personal access token.\n   * **Azure Active Directory**: Click **Sign in** and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n   * **Username / Password**: Not applicable.\n\n8. Click **Connect**.\n\n9. Select the Azure Databricks data to query from the Power BI **Navigator**.\n\n![Power BI Navigator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/power-bi-navigator.png)\n\n## Connect Power BI Desktop to Azure Databricks manually\n\nFollow these instructions, depending on your chosen authentication method, to connect to a cluster or SQL warehouse with Power BI Desktop.\n\nNote\n\nTo connect faster with Power BI Desktop, use Partner Connect.\n\n1. Get the [Server Hostname and HTTP Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/integrations/jdbc-odbc-bi.html#get-server-hostname-port-http-path-and-jdbc-url).\n\n2. Start Power BI Desktop.\n\n3. Click **Get data** or **File > Get data**.\n\n4. Click **Get data to get started**.\n\n5. Search for **Databricks**, then click the connector:\n\n   * **Azure Databricks**\n\n6. Click **Connect**.\n\n7. Enter the **Server Hostname** and **HTTP Path**.\n\n8. Select your **Data Connectivity mode**. For information about the difference between **Import** and **DirectQuery**, see [Use DirectQuery in Power BI Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-use-directquery).\n\n9. Click **OK**.\n\n10. Click your authentication method:\n\n    * **Personal Access Token**: Enter your Azure Databricks personal access token.\n    * **Azure Active Directory**: Click **Sign in** and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n    * **Username / Password**: Not applicable.\n\n11. Click **Connect**.\n\n12. Select the Azure Databricks data to query from the Power BI **Navigator**. If Unity Catalog is enabled for your workspace, select a catalog before you select a schema and a table.\n\n![Power BI Navigator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/power-bi-navigator.png)\n\n## Using a custom SQL query\n\nThe Databricks connector provides the `Databricks.Query` data source that allows a user to provide a custom SQL query.\n\n1. Follow the steps described in [Connect with Power BI Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/partners/bi/power-bi#manual-connection) to create a connection, using **Import** as the data connectivity mode.\n2. In the **Navigator**, right click the top-most item containing the selected host name and HTTP path and click **Transform Data** to open the Power Query Editor.\n\n![Click Transform Data in the Navigator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/power-bi-navigator-transform-data-source.png)\n3. In the function bar, replace the function name `Databricks.Catalogs` with `Databricks.Query` and apply the change. This creates a Power Query function that takes a SQL query as parameter.\n4. Enter the desired SQL query in the parameter field and click **Invoke**. This executes the query and a new table is created with the query results as its contents.\n\n## Access Azure Databricks data source using the Power BI service\n\nWhen you publish a report to the Power BI service, you connect to Azure Databricks using a personal access token. In the Power BI service, you can also enable single sign on (SSO) so that users can access reports built using DirectQuery storage mode by passing their Azure Active Directory credentials to Azure Databricks.\n\n1. Publish your Power BI report from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI service.\n\n2. Enable single sign on (SSO) access to the report and underlying data source.\n\n   1. Go to the underlying Azure Databricks dataset for the report in the Power BI service, expand **Data source credentials**, and click **Edit credentials**.\n   2.

You can also publish Power BI reports to the Power BI service and enable users to access the underlying Azure Databricks data using single sign-on (SSO), passing along the same Azure Active Directory credentials they use to access the report.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Power BI Desktop 2.85.681.0 or above. [Download the latest version](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=58494). To use data managed by Unity Catalog with Power BI, you must use Power BI Desktop 2.98.683.0 or above (October 2021 release).\n\nNote\n\nPower BI Desktop requires Windows. An alternative for other operating systems is to run Power BI Desktop on a physical host or a Windows-based virtual machine and then connect to it from your operating system.\n\nIf you use a version of Power BI Desktop below 2.85.681.0, you also need to install the [Databricks ODBC driver](https://databricks.com/spark/odbc-drivers-download) in the same environment as Power BI Desktop.\n\n* An Azure Databricks [personal access token](https://docs.databricks.com/api/azure/workspace/tokenmanagement) or your Azure Active Directory account credentials.\n\nNote\n\nAs a security best practice, when you authenticate with automated tools, systems, scripts, and apps, Databricks recommends that you use personal access tokens belonging to [service principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html) instead of workspace users. To create tokens for service principals, see [Manage tokens for a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html#personal-access-tokens).\n\n* An Azure Databricks [cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/clusters/configure.html) or Databricks SQL [warehouse](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/admin/create-sql-warehouse.html).\n\n## Connect Power BI Desktop to Azure Databricks using Partner Connect\n\nYou can use Partner Connect to connect to a cluster or SQL warehouse from Power BI Desktop in just a few clicks.\n\n1. Make sure your Azure Databricks account, workspace, and the signed-in user meet the [requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/partner-connect/index.html#requirements) for Partner Connect.\n\n2. In the sidebar, click ![Partner Connect button](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/partner-connect.png) **Partner Connect**.\n\n3. Click the **Power BI** tile.\n\n4. In the **Connect to partner** dialog, for **Compute**, choose the name of the Azure Databricks compute resource that you want to connect.\n\n5. Choose **Download connection file**.\n\n6. Open the downloaded connection file, which starts Power BI Desktop.\n\n7. In Power BI Desktop, enter your authentication credentials:\n\n   * **Personal Access Token**: Enter your Azure Databricks personal access token.\n   * **Azure Active Directory**: Click **Sign in** and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n   * **Username / Password**: Not applicable.\n\n8. Click **Connect**.\n\n9. Select the Azure Databricks data to query from the Power BI **Navigator**.\n\n![Power BI Navigator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/power-bi-navigator.png)\n\n## Connect Power BI Desktop to Azure Databricks manually\n\nFollow these instructions, depending on your chosen authentication method, to connect to a cluster or SQL warehouse with Power BI Desktop.\n\nNote\n\nTo connect faster with Power BI Desktop, use Partner Connect.\n\n1. Get the [Server Hostname and HTTP Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/integrations/jdbc-odbc-bi.html#get-server-hostname-port-http-path-and-jdbc-url).\n\n2. Start Power BI Desktop.\n\n3. Click **Get data** or **File > Get data**.\n\n4. Click **Get data to get started**.\n\n5. Search for **Databricks**, then click the connector:\n\n   * **Azure Databricks**\n\n6. Click **Connect**.\n\n7. Enter the **Server Hostname** and **HTTP Path**.\n\n8. Select your **Data Connectivity mode**. For information about the difference between **Import** and **DirectQuery**, see [Use DirectQuery in Power BI Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-use-directquery).\n\n9. Click **OK**.\n\n10. Click your authentication method:\n\n    * **Personal Access Token**: Enter your Azure Databricks personal access token.\n    * **Azure Active Directory**: Click **Sign in** and then follow the on-screen instructions.\n    * **Username / Password**: Not applicable.\n\n11. Click **Connect**.\n\n12. Select the Azure Databricks data to query from the Power BI **Navigator**. If Unity Catalog is enabled for your workspace, select a catalog before you select a schema and a table.\n\n![Power BI Navigator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/power-bi-navigator.png)\n\n## Using a custom SQL query\n\nThe Databricks connector provides the `Databricks.Query` data source that allows a user to provide a custom SQL query.\n\n1. Follow the steps described in [Connect with Power BI Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/partners/bi/power-bi#manual-connection) to create a connection, using **Import** as the data connectivity mode.\n2. In the **Navigator**, right click the top-most item containing the selected host name and HTTP path and click **Transform Data** to open the Power Query Editor.\n\n![Click Transform Data in the Navigator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/power-bi-navigator-transform-data-source.png)\n3. In the function bar, replace the function name `Databricks.Catalogs` with `Databricks.Query` and apply the change. This creates a Power Query function that takes a SQL query as parameter.\n4. Enter the desired SQL query in the parameter field and click **Invoke**. This executes the query and a new table is created with the query results as its contents.\n\n## Access Azure Databricks data source using the Power BI service\n\nWhen you publish a report to the Power BI service, you connect to Azure Databricks using a personal access token. In the Power BI service, you can also enable single sign on (SSO) so that users can access reports built using DirectQuery storage mode by passing their Azure Active Directory credentials to Azure Databricks.\n\n1. Publish your Power BI report from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI service.\n\n2. Enable single sign on (SSO) access to the report and underlying data source.\n\n   1. Go to the underlying Azure Databricks dataset for the report in the Power BI service, expand **Data source credentials**, and click **Edit credentials**.\n   2. On the configuration dialog, select **Report viewers can only access this data source with their own Power BI identities using Direct Query** and click **Sign in**.\n      ![Enable SSO for Databricks data access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/enable-sso.png)\n\nWith this option selected, access to the data source is handled using DirectQuery and managed using the Azure AD identity of the user who is accessing the report. If you don\u2019t select this option, only you, as the user who published the report, have access to the Azure Databricks data source.\n\n## Automated HTTP proxy detection\n\nPower BI Desktop version 2.104.941.0 and above (May 2022 release) has built-in support for detecting Windows system-wide HTTP proxy configuration.

Select **Run > Run selected text** or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`Enter`. If no text is highlighted, **Run Selected Text** executes the current line.\n\n![run selected lines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/run-selected-text.gif)\n\nIf you are using [mixed languages in a cell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebooks-code#language-magic), you must include the `%&lt;language&gt;` line in the selection.\n\n**Run selected text** also executes collapsed code, if there is any in the highlighted selection.\n\nSpecial cell commands such as `%run`, `%pip`, and `%sh` are supported.\n\nYou cannot use **Run selected text** on cells that have multiple output tabs (that is, cells where you have defined a data profile or visualization).\n\n## Format code cells\n\nAzure Databricks provides tools that allow you to format Python and SQL code in notebook cells quickly and easily. These tools reduce the effort to keep your code formatted and help to enforce the same coding standards across your notebooks.\n\n### Format Python cells\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in [Public Preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/release-notes/release-types.html).\n\nAzure Databricks supports Python code formatting using [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) within the notebook. The notebook must be attached to a cluster with `black` and `tokenize-rt` Python packages installed, and the Black formatter executes on the cluster that the notebook is attached to.\n\nOn Databricks Runtime 11.2 and above, Azure Databricks preinstalls `black` and `tokenize-rt`. You can use the formatter directly without needing to install these libraries.\n\nOn Databricks Runtime 11.1 and below, you must install `black==22.3.0` and `tokenize-rt==4.2.1` from PyPI on your notebook or cluster to use the Python formatter. You can run the following command in your notebook:\n\n```\n%pip install black==22.3.0 tokenize-rt==4.2.1\n\n```\n\nor [install the library on your cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/libraries/cluster-libraries.html).\n\nFor more details about installing libraries, see [Python environment management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/libraries/index.html#python-environment-management).\n\nFor files and notebooks in Databricks Repos, you can configure the Python formatter based on the `pyproject.toml` file. To use this feature, create a `pyproject.toml` file in the Repo root directory and configure it according to the [Black configuration format](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#configuration-format). Edit the [tool.black] section in the file. The configuration is applied when you format any file and notebook in that Repo.\n\n### How to format Python and SQL cells\n\nYou must have [Can Edit permission](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/auth-authz/access-control/workspace-acl.html#notebook-permissions) on the notebook to format code.\n\nYou can trigger the formatter in the following ways:\n\n* **Format a single cell**\n\n  + Keyboard shortcut: Press **Cmd+Shift+F**.\n\n  + Command context menu:\n\n    - Format SQL cell: Select **Format SQL** in the command context dropdown menu of a SQL cell. This menu item is visible only in SQL notebook cells or those with a `%sql` [language magic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebooks-code#language-magic).\n    - Format Python cell: Select **Format Python** in the command context dropdown menu of a Python cell. This menu item is visible only in Python notebook cells or those with a `%python` [language magic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebooks-code#language-magic).\n\n  + Notebook **Edit** menu: Select a Python or SQL cell, and then select **Edit > Format Cell(s)**.\n\n\n* **Format multiple cells**\n\nSelect [multiple cells](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebook-ui.html#add-a-cell) and then select **Edit > Format Cell(s)**. If you select cells of more than one language, only SQL and Python cells are formatted. This includes those that use `%sql` and `%python`.\n\n* **Format all Python and SQL cells in the notebook**\n\nSelect **Edit > Format Notebook**. If your notebook contains more than one language, only SQL and Python cells are formatted. This includes those that use `%sql` and `%python`.\n\n### Limitations of code formatting\n\n* Black enforces [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) standards for 4-space indentation. Indentation is not configurable.\n* Formatting embedded Python strings inside a SQL UDF is not supported. Similarly, formatting SQL strings inside a Python UDF is not supported.\n\n## Version history\n\nAzure Databricks notebooks maintain a history of notebook versions, allowing you to view and restore previous snapshots of the notebook. You can perform the following actions on versions: add comments, restore and delete versions, and clear version history.\n\nYou can also [sync your work in Databricks with a remote Git repository](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/repos/index.html).\n\nTo access notebook versions, click ![revision history icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/revision-history.png) in the right sidebar. The notebook revision history appears. You can also select **File > Version history**.\n\n### Add a comment\n\nTo add a comment to the latest version:\n\n1. Click the version.\n2. Click **Save now**.\n\n![Save comment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/revision-comment.png)\n3. In the Save Notebook Revision dialog, enter a comment.\n4. Click **Save**. The notebook version is saved with the entered comment.\n\n### Restore a version\n\nTo restore a version:\n\n1. Click the version.\n2. Click **Restore this revision**.\n\n![Restore revision](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/restore-revision.png)\n3. Click **Confirm**. The selected version becomes the latest version of the notebook.\n\n### Delete a version\n\nTo delete a version entry:\n\n1. Click the version.\n2. Click the trash icon ![Trash](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/trash-icon.png).\n\n![Delete revision](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/delete-revision.png)\n3. Click **Yes, erase**. The selected version is deleted from the history.\n\n### Clear version history\n\nThe version history cannot be recovered after it has been cleared.\n\nTo clear the version history for a notebook:\n\n1. Select **File > Clear version history**.\n2. Click **Yes, clear**. The notebook version history is cleared.\n\n## Code languages in notebooks\n\n### Set default language\n\nThe default language for the notebook appears next to the notebook name.\n\n![Notebook default language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/toolbar.png)\n\nTo change the default language, click the language button and select the new language from the dropdown menu. To ensure that existing commands continue to work, commands of the previous default language are automatically prefixed with a language magic command.\n\n### Mix languages\n\nBy default, cells use the default language of the notebook. You can override the default language in a cell by clicking the language button and selecting a language from the dropdown menu.\n\n![Cell language drop down](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/cell-language-button.png)\n\nAlternately, you can use the language magic command `%&lt;language&gt;` at the beginning of a cell. The supported magic commands are: `%python`, `%r`, `%scala`, and `%sql`.\n\nNote\n\nWhen you invoke a language magic command, the command is dispatched to the REPL in the [execution context](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/execution-context.html) for the notebook. Variables defined in one language (and hence in the REPL for that language) are not available in the REPL of another language. REPLs can share state only through external resources such as files in DBFS or objects in object storage.\n\nNotebooks also support a few auxiliary magic commands:\n\n* `%sh`: Allows you to run shell code in your notebook. To fail the cell if the shell command has a non-zero exit status, add the `-e` option. This command runs only on the Apache Spark driver, and not the workers. To run a shell command on all nodes, use an [init script](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/init-scripts/index.html).\n* `%fs`: Allows you to use `dbutils` filesystem commands. For example, to run the `dbutils.fs.ls` command to list files, you can specify `%fs ls` instead. For more information, see [How to work with files on Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/files/index.html).\n* `%md`: Allows you to include various types of documentation, including text, images, and mathematical formulas and equations. See the next section.\n\n### SQL syntax highlighting and autocomplete in Python commands\n\nSyntax highlighting and SQL [autocomplete](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebook-editor.html#autocomplete) are available when you use SQL inside a Python command, such as in a `spark.sql` command.\n\n### Explore SQL cell results in Python notebooks using Python\n\nYou might want to load data using SQL and explore it using Python. In a Databricks Python notebook, table results from a SQL language cell are automatically made available as a Python DataFrame assigned to the variable `_sqldf`.\n\n...\n']",['https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebooks-code'],"[

Click ![notebook data icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/notebook-data-icon.png) at the left side of the notebook to open the schema browser.\n\nThe **For you** button displays only those tables that you\u2019ve used in the current session or previously marked as a Favorite.\n\nAs you type text into the **Filter** box, the display changes to show only those items that contain the text you type. Only items that are currently open or have been opened in the current session appear. The **Filter** box does not do a complete search of the catalogs, schemas, and tables available for the notebook.\n\nTo open the ![Kebab menu](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/kebab-menu.png) kebab menu, hover the cursor over the item\u2019s name as shown:\n\n![kebab menu in schema browser](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/schema-browser-kebab.png)\n\nIf the item is a table, you can do the following:\n\n* Automatically create and run a cell to display a preview of the data in the table. Select **Preview in a new cell** from the kebab menu for the table.\n* View a catalog, schema, or table in Catalog Explorer. Select **Open in Catalog Explorer** from the kebab menu. A new tab opens showing the selected item.\n* Get the path to a catalog, schema, or table. Select **Copy \u2026 path** from the kebab menu for the item.\n* Add a table to Favorites. Select **Add table to favorites** from the kebab menu for the table.\n\nIf the item is a catalog, schema, or volume, you can copy the item\u2019s path or open it in Catalog Explorer.\n\nTo insert a table or column name directly into a cell:\n\n1. Click your cursor in the cell at the location you want to enter the name.\n2. Move your cursor over the table name or column name in the schema browser.\n3. Click the double arrow ![double arrow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/schema-browser-double-arrow.png)that appears at the right of the item\u2019s name.\n\n## Keyboard shortcuts\n\nTo display keyboard shortcuts, select **Help > Keyboard shortcuts**. The keyboard shortcuts available depend on whether the cursor is in a code cell (edit mode) or not (command mode).\n\n## Find and replace text\n\nTo find and replace text within a notebook, select **Edit > Find and Replace**. The current match is highlighted in orange and all other matches are highlighted in yellow.\n\n![Matching text](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/find-replace-example.png)\n\nTo replace the current match, click **Replace**. To replace all matches in the notebook, click **Replace All**.\n\nTo move between matches, click the **Prev** and **Next** buttons. You can also press\n**shift+enter** and **enter** to go to the previous and next matches, respectively.\n\nTo close the find and replace tool, click ![Delete Icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/delete-icon.png) or press **esc**.\n\n## Variable explorer\n\nYou can directly observe Python, Scala, and R variables in the notebook UI. For Python on Databricks Runtime 12.1 and above, the variables update as a cell runs. For Scala, R, and for Python on Databricks Runtime 12.0 and below, variables update after a cell finishes running.\n\nTo open the variable explorer, click ![the variable explorer icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/variable-explorer-icon.png) in [the right sidebar](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebook-ui.html#right-sidebar). The variable explorer opens, showing the value and data type, including shape, for each variable that is currently defined in the notebook. (The shape of a PySpark dataframe is \u2018?\u2019, because calculating the shape can be computationally expensive.)\n\nTo filter the display, enter text into the search box. The list is automatically filtered as you type.\n\nVariable values are automatically updated as you run notebook cells.\n\n![example variable explorer panel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/variable-explorer-example.png)\n\n## Modularize your code\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in [Public Preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/release-notes/release-types.html).\n\nWith Databricks Runtime 11.2 and above, you can create and manage source code files in the Azure Databricks workspace, and then import these files into your notebooks as needed.\n\nFor more information on working with source code files, see [Share code between Databricks notebooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/share-code.html) and [Work with Python and R modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/files/workspace-modules.html).\n\n## Run selected text\n\nYou can highlight code or SQL statements in a notebook cell and run only that selection. This is useful when you want to quickly iterate on code and queries.\n\n1. Highlight the lines you want to run.\n2. Select **Run > Run selected text** or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`Enter`. If no text is highlighted, **Run Selected Text** executes the current line.\n\n![run selected lines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/run-selected-text.gif)\n\nIf you are using [mixed languages in a cell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebooks-code#language-magic), you must include the `%&lt;language&gt;` line in the selection.\n\n**Run selected text** also executes collapsed code, if there is any in the highlighted selection.\n\nSpecial cell commands such as `%run`, `%pip`, and `%sh` are supported.\n\nYou cannot use **Run selected text** on cells that have multiple output tabs (that is, cells where you have defined a data profile or visualization).\n\n## Format code cells\n\nAzure Databricks provides tools that allow you to format Python and SQL code in notebook cells quickly and easily. These tools reduce the effort to keep your code formatted and help to enforce the same coding standards across your notebooks.\n\n### Format Python cells\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in [Public Preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/release-notes/release-types.html).\n\nAzure Databricks supports Python code formatting using [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) within the notebook. The notebook must be attached to a cluster with `black` and `tokenize-rt` Python packages installed, and the Black formatter executes on the cluster that the notebook is attached to.\n\nOn Databricks Runtime 11.2 and above, Azure Databricks preinstalls `black` and `tokenize-rt`. You can use the formatter directly without needing to install these libraries.\n\nOn Databricks Runtime 11.1 and below, you must install `black==22.3.0` and `tokenize-rt==4.2.1` from PyPI on your notebook or cluster to use the Python formatter. You can run the following command in your notebook:\n\n```\n%pip install black==22.3.0 tokenize-rt==4.2.1\n\n```\n\nor [install the library on your cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/libraries/cluster-libraries.html).\n\nFor more details about installing libraries, see [Python environment management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/libraries/index.html#python-environment-management).\n\nFor files and notebooks in Databricks Repos, you can configure the Python formatter based on the `pyproject.toml` file. To use this feature, create a `pyproject.toml` file in the Repo root directory and configure it according to the [Black configuration format](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#configuration-format). Edit the [tool.black] section in the file. The configuration is applied when you format any file and notebook in that Repo.\n\n### How to format Python and SQL cells\n\nYou must have [Can Edit permission](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/auth-authz/access-control/workspace-acl.html#notebook-permissions) on the notebook to format code.\n\nYou can trigger the formatter in the following ways:\n\n* **Format a single cell**\n\n  + Keyboard shortcut: Press **Cmd+Shift+F**.\n\n  + Command context menu:\n\n    - Format SQL cell: Select **Format SQL** in the command context dropdown menu of a SQL cell. This menu item is visible only in SQL notebook cells or those with a `%sql` [language magic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebooks-code#language-magic).\n    - Format Python cell: Select **Format Python** in the command context dropdown menu of a Python cell. This menu item is visible only in Python notebook cells or those with a `%python` [language magic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebooks-code#language-magic).\n\n  + Notebook **Edit** menu: Select a Python or SQL cell, and then select **Edit > Format Cell(s)**.\n\n\n* **Format multiple cells**\n\nSelect [multiple cells](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebook-ui.html#add-a-cell) and then select **Edit > Format Cell(s)**. If you select cells of more than one language, only SQL and Python cells are formatted. This includes those that use `%sql` and `%python`.\n\n* **Format all Python and SQL cells in the notebook**\n\nSelect **Edit > Format Notebook**. If your notebook contains more than one language, only SQL and Python cells are formatted. This includes those that use `%sql` and `%python`.\n\n### Limitations of code formatting\n\n* Black enforces [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) standards for 4-space indentation. Indentation is not configurable.\n* Formatting embedded Python strings inside a SQL UDF is not supported. Similarly, formatting SQL strings inside a Python UDF is not supported.\n\n## Version history\n\nAzure Databricks notebooks maintain a history of notebook versions, allowing you to view and restore previous snapshots of the notebook. You can perform the following actions on versions: add comments, restore and delete versions, and clear version history.\n\nYou can also [sync your work in Databricks with a remote Git repository](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/repos/index.html).\n\nTo access notebook versions, click ![revision history icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/revision-history.png) in the right sidebar. The notebook revision history appears. You can also select **File > Version history**.\n\n### Add a comment\n\nTo add a comment to the latest version:\n\n1. Click the version.\n2. Click **Save now**.\n\n![Save comment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/revision-comment.png)\n3. In the Save Notebook Revision dialog, enter a comment.\n4. Click **Save**. The notebook version is saved with the entered comment.\n\n### Restore a version\n\nTo restore a version:\n\n1. Click the version.\n2. Click **Restore this revision**.\n\n![Restore revision](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/restore-revision.png)\n3. Click **Confirm**. The selected version becomes the latest version of the notebook.\n\n### Delete a version\n\nTo delete a version entry:\n\n1. Click the version.\n2. Click the trash icon ![Trash](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/trash-icon.png).\n\n![Delete revision](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/delete-revision.png)\n3. Click **Yes, erase**. The selected version is deleted from the history.\n\n### Clear version history\n\nThe version history cannot be recovered after it has been cleared.\n\nTo clear the version history for a notebook:\n\n1. Select **File > Clear version history**.\n2. Click **Yes, clear**. The notebook version history is cleared.\n\n## Code languages in notebooks\n\n### Set default language\n\nThe default language for the notebook appears next to the notebook name.\n\n![Notebook default language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/toolbar.png)\n\nTo change the default language, click the language button and select the new language from the dropdown menu. To ensure that existing commands continue to work, commands of the previous default language are automatically prefixed with a language magic command.\n\n### Mix languages\n\nBy default, cells use the default language of the notebook. You can override the default language in a cell by clicking the language button and selecting a language from the dropdown menu.\n\n![Cell language drop down](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/cell-language-button.png)\n\nAlternately, you can use the language magic command `%&lt;language&gt;` at the beginning of a cell. The supported magic commands are: `%python`, `%r`, `%scala`, and `%sql`.\n\nNote\n\nWhen you invoke a language magic command, the command is dispatched to the REPL in the [execution context](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/execution-context.html) for the notebook. Variables defined in one language (and hence in the REPL for that language) are not available in the REPL of another language. REPLs can share state only through external resources such as files in DBFS or objects in object storage.\n\nNotebooks also support a few auxiliary magic commands:\n\n* `%sh`: Allows you to run shell code in your notebook. To fail the cell if the shell command has a non-zero exit status, add the `-e` option. This command runs only on the Apache Spark driver, and not the workers. To run a shell command on all nodes, use an [init script](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/init-scripts/index.html).\n* `%fs`: Allows you to use `dbutils` filesystem commands. For example, to run the `dbutils.fs.ls` command to list files, you can specify `%fs ls` instead. For more information, see [How to work with files on Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/files/index.html).\n* `%md`: Allows you to include various types of documentation, including text, images, and mathematical formulas and equations. See the next section.\n\n### SQL syntax highlighting and autocomplete in Python commands\n\nSyntax highlighting and SQL [autocomplete](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebook-editor.html#autocomplete) are available when you use SQL inside a Python command, such as in a `spark.sql` command.\n\n### Explore SQL cell results in Python notebooks using Python\n\nYou might want to load data using SQL and explore it using Python. In a Databricks Python notebook, table results from a SQL language cell are automatically made available as a Python DataFrame assigned to the variable `_sqldf`.\n\n...\n""

Otherwise, form a short reply that uses only text written in the documentation.\n\nRandom fetched documentation:\n````\n# Develop code in Databricks notebooks\n\nThis page describes how to develop code in Databricks notebooks, including autocomplete, automatic formatting for Python and SQL, combining Python and SQL in a notebook, and tracking the notebook revision history.\n\nFor more details about advanced functionality available with the editor, such as autocomplete, variable selection, multi-cursor support, and side-by-side diffs, see [Use the Databricks notebook and file editor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebook-editor.html).\n\n## Access notebook for editing\n\nTo open a notebook, use the workspace [Search function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/search/index.html) or use the workspace browser to [navigate to the notebook](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/workspace/workspace-objects.html) and click on the notebook\u2019s name or icon.\n\n## Browse data\n\nUse the schema browser to explore tables and volumes available for the notebook. Click ![notebook data icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/notebook-data-icon.png) at the left side of the notebook to open the schema browser.\n\nThe **For you** button displays only those tables that you\u2019ve used in the current session or previously marked as a Favorite.\n\nAs you type text into the **Filter** box, the display changes to show only those items that contain the text you type. Only items that are currently open or have been opened in the current session appear. The **Filter** box does not do a complete search of the catalogs, schemas, and tables available for the notebook.\n\nTo open the ![Kebab menu](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/kebab-menu.png) kebab menu, hover the cursor over the item\u2019s name as shown:\n\n![kebab menu in schema browser](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/schema-browser-kebab.png)\n\nIf the item is a table, you can do the following:\n\n* Automatically create and run a cell to display a preview of the data in the table. Select **Preview in a new cell** from the kebab menu for the table.\n* View a catalog, schema, or table in Catalog Explorer. Select **Open in Catalog Explorer** from the kebab menu. A new tab opens showing the selected item.\n* Get the path to a catalog, schema, or table. Select **Copy \u2026 path** from the kebab menu for the item.\n* Add a table to Favorites. Select **Add table to favorites** from the kebab menu for the table.\n\nIf the item is a catalog, schema, or volume, you can copy the item\u2019s path or open it in Catalog Explorer.\n\nTo insert a table or column name directly into a cell:\n\n1. Click your cursor in the cell at the location you want to enter the name.\n2. Move your cursor over the table name or column name in the schema browser.\n3. Click the double arrow ![double arrow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/schema-browser-double-arrow.png)that appears at the right of the item\u2019s name.\n\n## Keyboard shortcuts\n\nTo display keyboard shortcuts, select **Help > Keyboard shortcuts**. The keyboard shortcuts available depend on whether the cursor is in a code cell (edit mode) or not (command mode).\n\n## Find and replace text\n\nTo find and replace text within a notebook, select **Edit > Find and Replace**. The current match is highlighted in orange and all other matches are highlighted in yellow.\n\n![Matching text](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/find-replace-example.png)\n\nTo replace the current match, click **Replace**. To replace all matches in the notebook, click **Replace All**.\n\nTo move between matches, click the **Prev** and **Next** buttons. You can also press\n**shift+enter** and **enter** to go to the previous and next matches, respectively.\n\nTo close the find and replace tool, click ![Delete Icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/delete-icon.png) or press **esc**.\n\n## Variable explorer\n\nYou can directly observe Python, Scala, and R variables in the notebook UI. For Python on Databricks Runtime 12.1 and above, the variables update as a cell runs. For Scala, R, and for Python on Databricks Runtime 12.0 and below, variables update after a cell finishes running.\n\nTo open the variable explorer, click ![the variable explorer icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/variable-explorer-icon.png) in [the right sidebar](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebook-ui.html#right-sidebar). The variable explorer opens, showing the value and data type, including shape, for each variable that is currently defined in the notebook. (The shape of a PySpark dataframe is \u2018?\u2019, because calculating the shape can be computationally expensive.)\n\nTo filter the display, enter text into the search box. The list is automatically filtered as you type.\n\nVariable values are automatically updated as you run notebook cells.\n\n![example variable explorer panel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/variable-explorer-example.png)\n\n## Modularize your code\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in [Public Preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/release-notes/release-types.html).\n\nWith Databricks Runtime 11.2 and above, you can create and manage source code files in the Azure Databricks workspace, and then import these files into your notebooks as needed.\n\nFor more information on working with source code files, see [Share code between Databricks notebooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/share-code.html) and [Work with Python and R modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/files/workspace-modules.html).\n\n## Run selected text\n\nYou can highlight code or SQL statements in a notebook cell and run only that selection. This is useful when you want to quickly iterate on code and queries.\n\n1. Highlight the lines you want to run.\n2. Select **Run > Run selected text** or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`Enter`. If no text is highlighted, **Run Selected Text** executes the current line.\n\n![run selected lines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/run-selected-text.gif)\n\nIf you are using [mixed languages in a cell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebooks-code#language-magic), you must include the `%&lt;language&gt;` line in the selection.\n\n**Run selected text** also executes collapsed code, if there is any in the highlighted selection.\n\nSpecial cell commands such as `%run`, `%pip`, and `%sh` are supported.\n\nYou cannot use **Run selected text** on cells that have multiple output tabs (that is, cells where you have defined a data profile or visualization).\n\n## Format code cells\n\nAzure Databricks provides tools that allow you to format Python and SQL code in notebook cells quickly and easily. These tools reduce the effort to keep your code formatted and help to enforce the same coding standards across your notebooks.\n\n### Format Python cells\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in [Public Preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/release-notes/release-types.html).\n\nAzure Databricks supports Python code formatting using [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) within the notebook. The notebook must be attached to a cluster with `black` and `tokenize-rt` Python packages installed, and the Black formatter executes on the cluster that the notebook is attached to.\n\nOn Databricks Runtime 11.2 and above, Azure Databricks preinstalls `black` and `tokenize-rt`. You can use the formatter directly without needing to install these libraries.\n\nOn Databricks Runtime 11.1 and below, you must install `black==22.3.0` and `tokenize-rt==4.2.1` from PyPI on your notebook or cluster to use the Python formatter. You can run the following command in your notebook:\n\n```\n%pip install black==22.3.0 tokenize-rt==4.2.1\n\n```\n\nor [install the library on your cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/libraries/cluster-libraries.html).\n\nFor more details about installing libraries, see [Python environment management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/libraries/index.html#python-environment-management).\n\nFor files and notebooks in Databricks Repos, you can configure the Python formatter based on the `pyproject.toml` file. To use this feature, create a `pyproject.toml` file in the Repo root directory and configure it according to the [Black configuration format](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#configuration-format). Edit the [tool.black] section in the file. The configuration is applied when you format any file and notebook in that Repo.\n\n### How to format Python and SQL cells\n\nYou must have [Can Edit permission](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/auth-authz/access-control/workspace-acl.html#notebook-permissions) on the notebook to format code.\n\nYou can trigger the formatter in the following ways:\n\n* **Format a single cell**\n\n  + Keyboard shortcut: Press **Cmd+Shift+F**.\n\n  + Command context menu:\n\n    - Format SQL cell: Select **Format SQL** in the command context dropdown menu of a SQL cell. This menu item is visible only in SQL notebook cells or those with a `%sql` [language magic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebooks-code#language-magic).\n    - Format Python cell: Select **Format Python** in the command context dropdown menu of a Python cell. This menu item is visible only in Python notebook cells or those with a `%python` [language magic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebooks-code#language-magic).\n\n  + Notebook **Edit** menu: Select a Python or SQL cell, and then select **Edit > Format Cell(s)**.\n\n\n* **Format multiple cells**\n\nSelect [multiple cells](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebook-ui.html#add-a-cell) and then select **Edit > Format Cell(s)**. If you select cells of more than one language, only SQL and Python cells are formatted\n````\n\nProvided context:\n - \n The user is viewing a page titled \""Home - Workspace - Databricks\"" in the Databricks product.

Click ![notebook data icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/notebook-data-icon.png) at the left side of the notebook to open the schema browser.\n\nThe **For you** button displays only those tables that you\u2019ve used in the current session or previously marked as a Favorite.\n\nAs you type text into the **Filter** box, the display changes to show only those items that contain the text you type. Only items that are currently open or have been opened in the current session appear. The **Filter** box does not do a complete search of the catalogs, schemas, and tables available for the notebook.\n\nTo open the ![Kebab menu](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/kebab-menu.png) kebab menu, hover the cursor over the item\u2019s name as shown:\n\n![kebab menu in schema browser](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/schema-browser-kebab.png)\n\nIf the item is a table, you can do the following:\n\n* Automatically create and run a cell to display a preview of the data in the table. Select **Preview in a new cell** from the kebab menu for the table.\n* View a catalog, schema, or table in Catalog Explorer. Select **Open in Catalog Explorer** from the kebab menu. A new tab opens showing the selected item.\n* Get the path to a catalog, schema, or table. Select **Copy \u2026 path** from the kebab menu for the item.\n* Add a table to Favorites. Select **Add table to favorites** from the kebab menu for the table.\n\nIf the item is a catalog, schema, or volume, you can copy the item\u2019s path or open it in Catalog Explorer.\n\nTo insert a table or column name directly into a cell:\n\n1. Click your cursor in the cell at the location you want to enter the name.\n2. Move your cursor over the table name or column name in the schema browser.\n3. Click the double arrow ![double arrow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/schema-browser-double-arrow.png)that appears at the right of the item\u2019s name.\n\n## Keyboard shortcuts\n\nTo display keyboard shortcuts, select **Help > Keyboard shortcuts**. The keyboard shortcuts available depend on whether the cursor is in a code cell (edit mode) or not (command mode).\n\n## Find and replace text\n\nTo find and replace text within a notebook, select **Edit > Find and Replace**. The current match is highlighted in orange and all other matches are highlighted in yellow.\n\n![Matching text](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/find-replace-example.png)\n\nTo replace the current match, click **Replace**. To replace all matches in the notebook, click **Replace All**.\n\nTo move between matches, click the **Prev** and **Next** buttons. You can also press\n**shift+enter** and **enter** to go to the previous and next matches, respectively.\n\nTo close the find and replace tool, click ![Delete Icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/delete-icon.png) or press **esc**.\n\n## Variable explorer\n\nYou can directly observe Python, Scala, and R variables in the notebook UI. For Python on Databricks Runtime 12.1 and above, the variables update as a cell runs. For Scala, R, and for Python on Databricks Runtime 12.0 and below, variables update after a cell finishes running.\n\nTo open the variable explorer, click ![the variable explorer icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/variable-explorer-icon.png) in [the right sidebar](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebook-ui.html#right-sidebar). The variable explorer opens, showing the value and data type, including shape, for each variable that is currently defined in the notebook. (The shape of a PySpark dataframe is \u2018?\u2019, because calculating the shape can be computationally expensive.)\n\nTo filter the display, enter text into the search box. The list is automatically filtered as you type.\n\nVariable values are automatically updated as you run notebook cells.\n\n![example variable explorer panel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/variable-explorer-example.png)\n\n## Modularize your code\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in [Public Preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/release-notes/release-types.html).\n\nWith Databricks Runtime 11.2 and above, you can create and manage source code files in the Azure Databricks workspace, and then import these files into your notebooks as needed.\n\nFor more information on working with source code files, see [Share code between Databricks notebooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/share-code.html) and [Work with Python and R modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/files/workspace-modules.html).\n\n## Run selected text\n\nYou can highlight code or SQL statements in a notebook cell and run only that selection. This is useful when you want to quickly iterate on code and queries.\n\n1. Highlight the lines you want to run.\n2. Select **Run > Run selected text** or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`Enter`. If no text is highlighted, **Run Selected Text** executes the current line.\n\n![run selected lines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/run-selected-text.gif)\n\nIf you are using [mixed languages in a cell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebooks-code#language-magic), you must include the `%&lt;language&gt;` line in the selection.\n\n**Run selected text** also executes collapsed code, if there is any in the highlighted selection.\n\nSpecial cell commands such as `%run`, `%pip`, and `%sh` are supported.\n\nYou cannot use **Run selected text** on cells that have multiple output tabs (that is, cells where you have defined a data profile or visualization).\n\n## Format code cells\n\nAzure Databricks provides tools that allow you to format Python and SQL code in notebook cells quickly and easily. These tools reduce the effort to keep your code formatted and help to enforce the same coding standards across your notebooks.\n\n### Format Python cells\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in [Public Preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/release-notes/release-types.html).\n\nAzure Databricks supports Python code formatting using [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) within the notebook. The notebook must be attached to a cluster with `black` and `tokenize-rt` Python packages installed, and the Black formatter executes on the cluster that the notebook is attached to.\n\nOn Databricks Runtime 11.2 and above, Azure Databricks preinstalls `black` and `tokenize-rt`. You can use the formatter directly without needing to install these libraries.\n\nOn Databricks Runtime 11.1 and below, you must install `black==22.3.0` and `tokenize-rt==4.2.1` from PyPI on your notebook or cluster to use the Python formatter. You can run the following command in your notebook:\n\n```\n%pip install black==22.3.0 tokenize-rt==4.2.1\n\n```\n\nor [install the library on your cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/libraries/cluster-libraries.html).\n\nFor more details about installing libraries, see [Python environment management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/libraries/index.html#python-environment-management).\n\nFor files and notebooks in Databricks Repos, you can configure the Python formatter based on the `pyproject.toml` file. To use this feature, create a `pyproject.toml` file in the Repo root directory and configure it according to the [Black configuration format](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#configuration-format). Edit the [tool.black] section in the file. The configuration is applied when you format any file and notebook in that Repo.\n\n### How to format Python and SQL cells\n\nYou must have [Can Edit permission](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/auth-authz/access-control/workspace-acl.html#notebook-permissions) on the notebook to format code.\n\nYou can trigger the formatter in the following ways:\n\n* **Format a single cell**\n\n  + Keyboard shortcut: Press **Cmd+Shift+F**.\n\n  + Command context menu:\n\n    - Format SQL cell: Select **Format SQL** in the command context dropdown menu of a SQL cell. This menu item is visible only in SQL notebook cells or those with a `%sql` [language magic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebooks-code#language-magic).\n    - Format Python cell: Select **Format Python** in the command context dropdown menu of a Python cell. This menu item is visible only in Python notebook cells or those with a `%python` [language magic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebooks-code#language-magic).\n\n  + Notebook **Edit** menu: Select a Python or SQL cell, and then select **Edit > Format Cell(s)**.\n\n\n* **Format multiple cells**\n\nSelect [multiple cells](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebook-ui.html#add-a-cell) and then select **Edit > Format Cell(s)**. If you select cells of more than one language, only SQL and Python cells are formatted. This includes those that use `%sql` and `%python`.\n\n* **Format all Python and SQL cells in the notebook**\n\nSelect **Edit > Format Notebook**. If your notebook contains more than one language, only SQL and Python cells are formatted. This includes those that use `%sql` and `%python`.\n\n### Limitations of code formatting\n\n* Black enforces [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) standards for 4-space indentation. Indentation is not configurable.\n* Formatting embedded Python strings inside a SQL UDF is not supported. Similarly, formatting SQL strings inside a Python UDF is not supported.\n\n## Version history\n\nAzure Databricks notebooks maintain a history of notebook versions, allowing you to view and restore previous snapshots of the notebook. You can perform the following actions on versions: add comments, restore and delete versions, and clear version history.\n\nYou can also [sync your work in Databricks with a remote Git repository](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/repos/index.html).\n\nTo access notebook versions, click ![revision history icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/revision-history.png) in the right sidebar. The notebook revision history appears. You can also select **File > Version history**.\n\n### Add a comment\n\nTo add a comment to the latest version:\n\n1. Click the version.\n2. Click **Save now**.\n\n![Save comment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/revision-comment.png)\n3. In the Save Notebook Revision dialog, enter a comment.\n4. Click **Save**. The notebook version is saved with the entered comment.\n\n### Restore a version\n\nTo restore a version:\n\n1. Click the version.\n2. Click **Restore this revision**.\n\n![Restore revision](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/restore-revision.png)\n3. Click **Confirm**. The selected version becomes the latest version of the notebook.\n\n### Delete a version\n\nTo delete a version entry:\n\n1. Click the version.\n2. Click the trash icon ![Trash](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/trash-icon.png).\n\n![Delete revision](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/delete-revision.png)\n3. Click **Yes, erase**. The selected version is deleted from the history.\n\n### Clear version history\n\nThe version history cannot be recovered after it has been cleared.\n\nTo clear the version history for a notebook:\n\n1. Select **File > Clear version history**.\n2. Click **Yes, clear**. The notebook version history is cleared.\n\n## Code languages in notebooks\n\n### Set default language\n\nThe default language for the notebook appears next to the notebook name.\n\n![Notebook default language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/toolbar.png)\n\nTo change the default language, click the language button and select the new language from the dropdown menu. To ensure that existing commands continue to work, commands of the previous default language are automatically prefixed with a language magic command.\n\n### Mix languages\n\nBy default, cells use the default language of the notebook. You can override the default language in a cell by clicking the language button and selecting a language from the dropdown menu.\n\n![Cell language drop down](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/cell-language-button.png)\n\nAlternately, you can use the language magic command `%&lt;language&gt;` at the beginning of a cell. The supported magic commands are: `%python`, `%r`, `%scala`, and `%sql`.\n\nNote\n\nWhen you invoke a language magic command, the command is dispatched to the REPL in the [execution context](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/execution-context.html) for the notebook. Variables defined in one language (and hence in the REPL for that language) are not available in the REPL of another language. REPLs can share state only through external resources such as files in DBFS or objects in object storage.\n\nNotebooks also support a few auxiliary magic commands:\n\n* `%sh`: Allows you to run shell code in your notebook. To fail the cell if the shell command has a non-zero exit status, add the `-e` option. This command runs only on the Apache Spark driver, and not the workers. To run a shell command on all nodes, use an [init script](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/init-scripts/index.html).\n* `%fs`: Allows you to use `dbutils` filesystem commands. For example, to run the `dbutils.fs.ls` command to list files, you can specify `%fs ls` instead. For more information, see [How to work with files on Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/files/index.html).\n* `%md`: Allows you to include various types of documentation, including text, images, and mathematical formulas and equations. See the next section.\n\n### SQL syntax highlighting and autocomplete in Python commands\n\nSyntax highlighting and SQL [autocomplete](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebook-editor.html#autocomplete) are available when you use SQL inside a Python command, such as in a `spark.sql` command.\n\n### Explore SQL cell results in Python notebooks using Python\n\nYou might want to load data using SQL and explore it using Python. In a Databricks Python notebook, table results from a SQL language cell are automatically made available as a Python DataFrame assigned to the variable `_sqldf`.\n\n...\n""

For Scala, R, and for Python on Databricks Runtime 12.0 and below, variables update after a cell finishes running.\n\nTo open the variable explorer, click ![the variable explorer icon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/variable-explorer-icon.png) in [the right sidebar](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebook-ui.html#right-sidebar). The variable explorer opens, showing the value and data type, including shape, for each variable that is currently defined in the notebook. (The shape of a PySpark dataframe is \u2018?\u2019, because calculating the shape can be computationally expensive.)\n\nTo filter the display, enter text into the search box. The list is automatically filtered as you type.\n\nVariable values are automatically updated as you run notebook cells.\n\n![example variable explorer panel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/variable-explorer-example.png)\n\n## Modularize your code\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in [Public Preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/release-notes/release-types.html).\n\nWith Databricks Runtime 11.2 and above, you can create and manage source code files in the Azure Databricks workspace, and then import these files into your notebooks as needed.\n\nFor more information on working with source code files, see [Share code between Databricks notebooks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/share-code.html) and [Work with Python and R modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/files/workspace-modules.html).\n\n## Run selected text\n\nYou can highlight code or SQL statements in a notebook cell and run only that selection. This is useful when you want to quickly iterate on code and queries.\n\n1. Highlight the lines you want to run.\n2. Select **Run > Run selected text** or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`Enter`. If no text is highlighted, **Run Selected Text** executes the current line.\n\n![run selected lines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/run-selected-text.gif)\n\nIf you are using [mixed languages in a cell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebooks-code#language-magic), you must include the `%&lt;language&gt;` line in the selection.\n\n**Run selected text** also executes collapsed code, if there is any in the highlighted selection.\n\nSpecial cell commands such as `%run`, `%pip`, and `%sh` are supported.\n\nYou cannot use **Run selected text** on cells that have multiple output tabs (that is, cells where you have defined a data profile or visualization).\n\n## Format code cells\n\nAzure Databricks provides tools that allow you to format Python and SQL code in notebook cells quickly and easily. These tools reduce the effort to keep your code formatted and help to enforce the same coding standards across your notebooks.\n\n### Format Python cells\n\nPreview\n\nThis feature is in [Public Preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/release-notes/release-types.html).\n\nAzure Databricks supports Python code formatting using [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) within the notebook. The notebook must be attached to a cluster with `black` and `tokenize-rt` Python packages installed, and the Black formatter executes on the cluster that the notebook is attached to.\n\nOn Databricks Runtime 11.2 and above, Azure Databricks preinstalls `black` and `tokenize-rt`. You can use the formatter directly without needing to install these libraries.\n\nOn Databricks Runtime 11.1 and below, you must install `black==22.3.0` and `tokenize-rt==4.2.1` from PyPI on your notebook or cluster to use the Python formatter. You can run the following command in your notebook:\n\n```\n%pip install black==22.3.0 tokenize-rt==4.2.1\n\n```\n\nor [install the library on your cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/libraries/cluster-libraries.html).\n\nFor more details about installing libraries, see [Python environment management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/libraries/index.html#python-environment-management).\n\nFor files and notebooks in Databricks Repos, you can configure the Python formatter based on the `pyproject.toml` file. To use this feature, create a `pyproject.toml` file in the Repo root directory and configure it according to the [Black configuration format](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#configuration-format). Edit the [tool.black] section in the file. The configuration is applied when you format any file and notebook in that Repo.\n\n### How to format Python and SQL cells\n\nYou must have [Can Edit permission](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/auth-authz/access-control/workspace-acl.html#notebook-permissions) on the notebook to format code.\n\nYou can trigger the formatter in the following ways:\n\n* **Format a single cell**\n\n  + Keyboard shortcut: Press **Cmd+Shift+F**.\n\n  + Command context menu:\n\n    - Format SQL cell: Select **Format SQL** in the command context dropdown menu of a SQL cell. This menu item is visible only in SQL notebook cells or those with a `%sql` [language magic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebooks-code#language-magic).\n    - Format Python cell: Select **Format Python** in the command context dropdown menu of a Python cell. This menu item is visible only in Python notebook cells or those with a `%python` [language magic](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebooks-code#language-magic).\n\n  + Notebook **Edit** menu: Select a Python or SQL cell, and then select **Edit > Format Cell(s)**.\n\n\n* **Format multiple cells**\n\nSelect [multiple cells](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/notebooks/notebook-ui.html#add-a-cell) and then select **Edit > Format Cell(s)**. If you select cells of more than one language, only SQL and Python cells are formatted\n````\n\nProvided context:\n - \n The user is viewing a page titled \""Home - Workspace - Databricks\"" in the Databricks product.

uninstall databricks and remove from path in web terminal,"To uninstall the Databricks CLI and remove it from the path in the web terminal, you can run the following command:

```
databricks unconfigure --token

This command removes the authentication token and clears the configuration file. If you want to completely remove the CLI, you can also delete the CLI installation directory. The default installation directory is `/usr/local/bin/databricks-cli`. You can delete it by running the following command:

```
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/databricks-cli

You can find more information on modifying shell configuration files in the documentation for your shell.']","['# Databricks CLI tutorial\n\nNote\n\nThis information applies to Databricks CLI versions 0.200 and above, which are in [Public Preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/release-notes/release-types.html). To find your version of the Databricks CLI, run `databricks -v`.\n\nFor information beyond this tutorial about Databricks CLI versions 0.200 and above, see the [Databricks CLI reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html).\n\nThe Databricks command-line interface (also known as the Databricks CLI) utility provides an easy-to-use interface to automate the Azure Databricks platform from your terminal, command prompt, or automation scripts.\n\nThis article demonstrates how to quickly get started with the Databricks CLI.\n\nThe following hands-on tutorial assumes:\n\n* You have [curl](https://everything.curl.dev/get) installed.\n* You have an Azure Databricks [personal access token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/auth.html#pat) that maps to your Azure Databricks user account for the target Azure Databricks workspace that you want to run the Databricks CLI against.\n* If you are using Linux or macOS, you are running a Linux-style terminal, such as `bash` or `zsh` or the macOS Terminal app.\n* If you are using Windows, you are running a Linux-style terminal, such as the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install), or Git BASH in [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).\n\nComplete the following steps:\n\n1. From your terminal, run the following command to use `curl` to install the CLI:\n\n```\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks/setup-cli/main/install.sh | sh\n\n```\n\nNote\n\nFor Linux or macOS, if an error message states that `/usr/local/bin` is not writable, then run the command again with `sudo`.\n2. Run the CLI’s `configure` command to configure authentication between the CLI and your workspace:\n\n```\ndatabricks configure\n\n```\n\n3. At the first prompt,  `Databricks Host: https://`, enter your [workspace URL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/workspace/workspace-details.html#workspace-url) and press `Enter`.\n4. At the second prompt, `Personal Access Token`, enter your personal access token value and press `Enter`.\n\n## Next steps\n\nAfter you set up the Databricks CLI:\n\n* To learn how to use the CLI, see [Use the CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#use-the-cli).\n* If the CLI does not run or produces unexpected results, see [Verify your CLI installation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/migrate.html#verify-install).\n* To configure the CLI to work with multiple Azure Databricks workspaces as well as with Azure Databricks accounts, see [Get information about configuration profiles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#using-profiles).\n* To use Azure Databricks authentication types other than personal access token authentication, see [Set up authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#cli-auth).\n* For more advanced CLI installation and update instructions, see [Install the CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#install-the-cli) and [Update the CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#update-the-cli).\n\n### Run the Databricks CLI on a cluster\n\nIf you want to install, configure, and run the Databricks CLI on an Azure Databricks [cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/clusters/configure.html) instead of on your local machine, the fastest way to do this is as follows:\n\n1. In the Azure Databricks workspace user interface, on the sidebar, click **Compute**.\n2. Click the name of the existing cluster that you want to install the Databricks CLI on.\n3. Click **Start**, if the cluster is not already running.\n4. After the cluster is running, on the **Apps** tab, click **Web Terminal**. A Bash-style terminal appears, and `curl` is already installed.\n5. Continue with the procedure at the beginning of this article to install, configure, and run the CLI on the cluster.\n\nNote that whenever you click **Start** to start the cluster, you must then reinstall and reconfigure the CLI on the cluster. This is because a new virtual machine is provisioned each time you click **Start**, and the new virtual machine does not include the CLI by default.\n']",['https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli'],"[

To find your version of the Databricks CLI, run `databricks -v`.\n\nFor information beyond this tutorial about Databricks CLI versions 0.200 and above, see the [Databricks CLI reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html).\n\nThe Databricks command-line interface (also known as the Databricks CLI) utility provides an easy-to-use interface to automate the Azure Databricks platform from your terminal, command prompt, or automation scripts.\n\nThis article demonstrates how to quickly get started with the Databricks CLI.\n\nThe following hands-on tutorial assumes:\n\n* You have [curl](https://everything.curl.dev/get) installed.\n* You have an Azure Databricks [personal access token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/auth.html#pat) that maps to your Azure Databricks user account for the target Azure Databricks workspace that you want to run the Databricks CLI against.\n* If you are using Linux or macOS, you are running a Linux-style terminal, such as `bash` or `zsh` or the macOS Terminal app.\n* If you are using Windows, you are running a Linux-style terminal, such as the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install), or Git BASH in [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).\n\nComplete the following steps:\n\n1. From your terminal, run the following command to use `curl` to install the CLI:\n\n```\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks/setup-cli/main/install.sh | sh\n\n```\n\nNote\n\nFor Linux or macOS, if an error message states that `/usr/local/bin` is not writable, then run the command again with `sudo`.\n2. Run the CLI\u2019s `configure` command to configure authentication between the CLI and your workspace:\n\n```\ndatabricks configure\n\n```\n\n3. At the first prompt,  `Databricks Host: https://`, enter your [workspace URL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/workspace/workspace-details.html#workspace-url) and press `Enter`.\n4. At the second prompt, `Personal Access Token`, enter your personal access token value and press `Enter`.\n\n## Next steps\n\nAfter you set up the Databricks CLI:\n\n* To learn how to use the CLI, see [Use the CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#use-the-cli).\n* If the CLI does not run or produces unexpected results, see [Verify your CLI installation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/migrate.html#verify-install).\n* To configure the CLI to work with multiple Azure Databricks workspaces as well as with Azure Databricks accounts, see [Get information about configuration profiles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#using-profiles).\n* To use Azure Databricks authentication types other than personal access token authentication, see [Set up authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#cli-auth).\n* For more advanced CLI installation and update instructions, see [Install the CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#install-the-cli) and [Update the CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#update-the-cli).\n\n### Run the Databricks CLI on a cluster\n\nIf you want to install, configure, and run the Databricks CLI on an Azure Databricks [cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/clusters/configure.html) instead of on your local machine, the fastest way to do this is as follows:\n\n1. In the Azure Databricks workspace user interface, on the sidebar, click **Compute**.\n2. Click the name of the existing cluster that you want to install the Databricks CLI on.\n3. Click **Start**, if the cluster is not already running.\n4. After the cluster is running, on the **Apps** tab, click **Web Terminal**. A Bash-style terminal appears, and `curl` is already installed.\n5. Continue with the procedure at the beginning of this article to install, configure, and run the CLI on the cluster.\n\nNote that whenever you click **Start** to start the cluster, you must then reinstall and reconfigure the CLI on the cluster. This is because a new virtual machine is provisioned each time you click **Start**, and the new virtual machine does not include the CLI by default.\n""

To find your version of the Databricks CLI, run `databricks -v`.\n\nFor information beyond this tutorial about Databricks CLI versions 0.200 and above, see the [Databricks CLI reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html).\n\nThe Databricks command-line interface (also known as the Databricks CLI) utility provides an easy-to-use interface to automate the Azure Databricks platform from your terminal, command prompt, or automation scripts.\n\nThis article demonstrates how to quickly get started with the Databricks CLI.\n\nThe following hands-on tutorial assumes:\n\n* You have [curl](https://everything.curl.dev/get) installed.\n* You have an Azure Databricks [personal access token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/auth.html#pat) that maps to your Azure Databricks user account for the target Azure Databricks workspace that you want to run the Databricks CLI against.\n* If you are using Linux or macOS, you are running a Linux-style terminal, such as `bash` or `zsh` or the macOS Terminal app.\n* If you are using Windows, you are running a Linux-style terminal, such as the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install), or Git BASH in [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).\n\nComplete the following steps:\n\n1. From your terminal, run the following command to use `curl` to install the CLI:\n\n```\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks/setup-cli/main/install.sh | sh\n\n```\n\nNote\n\nFor Linux or macOS, if an error message states that `/usr/local/bin` is not writable, then run the command again with `sudo`.\n2. Run the CLI\u2019s `configure` command to configure authentication between the CLI and your workspace:\n\n```\ndatabricks configure\n\n```\n\n3. At the first prompt,  `Databricks Host: https://`, enter your [workspace URL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/workspace/workspace-details.html#workspace-url) and press `Enter`.\n4. At the second prompt, `Personal Access Token`, enter your personal access token value and press `Enter`.\n\n## Next steps\n\nAfter you set up the Databricks CLI:\n\n* To learn how to use the CLI, see [Use the CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#use-the-cli).\n* If the CLI does not run or produces unexpected results, see [Verify your CLI installation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/migrate.html#verify-install).\n* To configure the CLI to work with multiple Azure Databricks workspaces as well as with Azure Databricks accounts, see [Get information about configuration profiles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#using-profiles).\n* To use Azure Databricks authentication types other than personal access token authentication, see [Set up authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#cli-auth).\n* For more advanced CLI installation and update instructions, see [Install the CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#install-the-cli) and [Update the CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#update-the-cli).\n\n### Run the Databricks CLI on a cluster\n\nIf you want to install, configure, and run the Databricks CLI on an Azure Databricks [cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/clusters/configure.html) instead of on your local machine, the fastest way to do this is as follows:\n\n1. In the Azure Databricks workspace user interface, on the sidebar, click **Compute**.\n2. Click the name of the existing cluster that you want to install the Databricks CLI on.\n3. Click **Start**, if the cluster is not already running.\n4. After the cluster is running, on the **Apps** tab, click **Web Terminal**. A Bash-style terminal appears, and `curl` is already installed.\n5. Continue with the procedure at the beginning of this article to install, configure, and run the CLI on the cluster.\n\nNote that whenever you click **Start** to start the cluster, you must then reinstall and reconfigure the CLI on the cluster. This is because a new virtual machine is provisioned each time you click **Start**, and the new virtual machine does not include the CLI by default.\n""

To migrate an existing pipeline that writes to Hive metastore, you must create a new pipeline and re-ingest data from the data source(s).\\n* You cannot create a Unity Catalog-enabled pipeline in a workspace attached to a metastore created during the Unity Catalog public preview. See [Upgrade to privilege inheritance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/upgrade-privilege-model.html).\\n* Init scripts, third-party libraries and JARs are not supported.\\n* Data manipulation language (DML) queries that modify the schema of a streaming table are not supported.\\n* A materialized view created in a Delta Live Tables pipeline cannot be used as a streaming source outside of that pipeline, for example, in another pipeline or in a downstream notebook.\\n* You cannot change the owner of a pipeline that uses Unity Catalog.\\n* Publishing to schemas that specify a managed storage location is not supported. All tables are stored in the catalog storage location if the target catalog specifies one, otherwise, they are stored in the metastore root storage location.\\n* The **History** tab in Catalog Explorer does not show history for streaming tables and materialized views.\\n* The `LOCATION` property is not supported when defining a table.\\n* Unity Catalog-enabled pipelines cannot publish to the Hive metastore.\\n* Python UDF support is in Private Preview. To have this feature enabled, contact your Databricks field engineering representative. When UDF support is enabled, to use Python UDFs in a pipeline you must add the `&quot;PythonUDF.enabled&quot;: &quot;true&quot;` custom cluster tag to both the default and maintenance clusters for the pipeline.\\n* You cannot use [Delta Sharing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-sharing/index.html) with a Delta Live Tables materialized view or streaming table published to Unity Catalog.\\n* You cannot use the `event log` [table valued function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log-with-uc) in a pipeline or query to access the event logs of multiple pipelines.\\n* You cannot share a view created over the `event_log` [table valued function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log-with-uc) with other users.\\n* Single-node clusters are not supported with Unity Catalog-enabled pipelines. Because Delta Live Tables might create a single-node cluster to run smaller pipelines, your pipeline might fail with an error message referencing `single-node mode`. If this occurs, make sure you specify at least one worker when you [Configure your compute settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/settings.html#cluster-config).\\n* Tables created in a Unity Catalog-enabled pipeline cannot be queried from assigned or no isolation clusters. To query tables created by a Delta Live Tables pipeline, you must use a shared cluster using Databricks Runtime 13.1 and above or a SQL warehouse.\\n* Delta Live Tables uses a shared cluster to run a Unity Catalog-enabled pipeline. A Unity Catalog-enabled pipeline cannot run on an assigned cluster.\\n\\nNote\\n\\nThe underlying files supporting materialized views might include data from upstream tables (including possible personally identifiable information) that do not appear in the materialized view definition. This data is automatically added to the underlying storage to support incremental refreshing of materialized views.\\n\\nBecause the underlying files of a materialized view might risk exposing data from upstream tables not part of the materialized view schema, Databricks recommends not sharing the underlying storage with untrusted downstream consumers.\\n\\nFor example, suppose the definition of a materialized view includes a `COUNT(DISTINCT field_a)` clause. Even though the materialized view definition only includes the aggregate `COUNT DISTINCT` clause, the underlying files will contain a list of the actual values of `field_a`.\\n\\n## Changes to existing functionality\\n\\nWhen Delta Live Tables is configured to persist data to Unity Catalog, the lifecycle of the table is managed by the Delta Live Tables pipeline. Because the pipeline manages the table lifecycle and permissions:\\n\\n* When a table is removed from the Delta Live Tables pipeline definition, the corresponding materialized view or streaming table entry is removed from Unity Catalog on the next pipeline update. The actual data is retained for a period of time so that it can be recovered if it was deleted by mistake. The data can be recovered by adding the materialized view or streaming table back into the pipeline definition.\\n* Deleting the Delta Live Tables pipeline results in deletion of all tables defined in that pipeline. Because of this change, the Delta Live Tables UI is updated to prompt you to confirm deletion of a pipeline.\\n* Internal backing tables, including backing tables used to support `APPLY CHANGES INTO`, are not directly accessible by users.\\n\\n## Write tables to Unity Catalog from a Delta Live Tables pipeline\\n\\nTo write your tables to Unity Catalog, when you [create a pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-pipelines.html#create-pipeline), select **Unity Catalog** under **Storage options**, select a catalog in the **Catalog** dropdown menu, and provide a database name in the **Target schema** field.\\n\\n## Ingest data into a Unity Catalog pipeline\\n\\nYour pipeline configured to use Unity Catalog can read data from:\\n\\n* Unity Catalog managed and external tables, views, materialized views and streaming tables.\\n* Hive metastore tables and views.\\n* Auto Loader using the `cloud_files()` function to read from Unity Catalog external locations.\\n* Apache Kafka and Amazon Kinesis.\\n\\nThe following are examples of reading from Unity Catalog and Hive metastore tables.\\n\\n### Batch ingestion from a Unity Catalog table\\n\\n```\\nCREATE OR REFRESH LIVE TABLE\\n table_name\\nAS SELECT\\n \\\\*\\nFROM\\n my_catalog.my_schema.table1;\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.table\\ndef table_name():\\n  return spark.table(""my_catalog.my_schema.table"")\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Stream changes from a Unity Catalog table\\n\\n```\\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE\\n table_name\\nAS SELECT\\n \\\\*\\nFROM\\n STREAM(my_catalog.my_schema.table1);\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.table\\ndef table_name():\\n  return spark.readStream.table(""my_catalog.my_schema.table"")\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Ingest data from Hive metastore\\n\\nA pipeline that uses Unity Catalog can read data from Hive metastore tables using the `hive_metastore` catalog:\\n\\n```\\nCREATE OR REFRESH LIVE TABLE\\n table_name\\nAS SELECT\\n \\\\*\\nFROM\\n hive_metastore.some_schema.table;\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.table\\ndef table3():\\n  return spark.table(""hive_metastore.some_schema.table"")\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Ingest data from Auto Loader\\n\\n```\\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE\\n table_name\\nAS SELECT\\n \\\\*\\nFROM\\n cloud_files(\\n <path-to-uc-external-location>,\\n ""json""\\n )\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.table(table_properties={""quality"": ""bronze""})\\ndef table_name():\\n  return (\\n     spark.readStream.format(""cloudFiles"")\\n     .option(""cloudFiles.format"", ""json"")\\n     .load(f""{path_to_uc_external_location}"")\\n )\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Share materialized views (live tables)\\n\\nBy default, the tables created by a pipeline can be queried only by the pipeline owner. You can give other users the ability to query a table by using [GRANT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/security-grant.html) statements and you can revoke query access using [REVOKE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/security-revoke.html) statements. For more information about privileges in Unity Catalog, see [Manage privileges in Unity Catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/index.html).\\n\\n### Grant select on a table\\n\\n```\\nGRANT SELECT ON TABLE\\n my_catalog.my_schema.live_table\\nTO\\n REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@databricks.com`\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Revoke select on a table\\n\\n```\\nREVOKE SELECT ON TABLE\\n my_catalog.my_schema.live_table\\nFROM\\n REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@databricks.com`\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Grant create table or create materialized view privileges\\n\\n```\\nGRANT CREATE { MATERIALIZED VIEW | TABLE } ON SCHEMA\\n  my_catalog.my_schema\\nTO\\n  { principal | user }\\n\\n```\\n\\n## View lineage for a pipeline\\n\\nLineage for tables in a Delta Live Tables pipeline is visible in Catalog Explorer. For materialized views or streaming tables in a Unity Catalog-enabled pipeline, the Catalog Explorer lineage UI shows the upstream and downstream tables. Lineage is only displayed between tables defined in the pipeline; tables that are defined outside of the pipeline and read in the pipeline are not shown in the Catalog Explorer lineage UI. To learn more about Unity Catalog lineage, see [Capture and view data lineage with Unity Catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/data-lineage.html).\\n\\nFor a materialized view or streaming table in a Unity Catalog-enabled Delta Live Tables pipeline, the Catalog Explorer lineage UI will also link to the pipeline that produced the materialized view or streaming table if the pipeline is accessible from the current workspace.\\n\\n## Add, change, or delete data in a streaming table\\n\\nYou can use [data manipulation language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/index.html#dml-statements) (DML) statements, including insert, update, delete, and merge statements, to modify streaming tables published to Unity Catalog. Support for DML queries against streaming tables enables use cases such as updating tables for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance.\\n\\nNote\\n\\n* DML statements that modify the table schema of a streaming table are not supported. Ensure that your DML statements do not attempt to evolve the table schema.\\n* DML statements that update a streaming table can be run only in a shared Unity Catalog cluster or a SQL warehouse using Databricks Runtime 13.1 and above.\\n\\nThe following are examples of DML statements to modify records in a streaming table.\\n\\n### Delete records with a specific ID:\\n\\n```\\nDELETE FROM my_streaming_table WHERE id = 123;\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Update records with a specific ID:\\n\\n```\\nUPDATE my_streaming_table SET name = \'Jane Doe\' WHERE id = 123;\\n\\n```\\n']",['https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/unity-catalog'],"[

If this occurs, make sure you specify at least one worker when you [Configure your compute settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/settings.html#cluster-config).\\n* Tables created in a Unity Catalog-enabled pipeline cannot be queried from assigned or no isolation clusters. To query tables created by a Delta Live Tables pipeline, you must use a shared cluster using Databricks Runtime 13.1 and above or a SQL warehouse.\\n* Delta Live Tables uses a shared cluster to run a Unity Catalog-enabled pipeline. A Unity Catalog-enabled pipeline cannot run on an assigned cluster.\\n\\nNote\\n\\nThe underlying files supporting materialized views might include data from upstream tables (including possible personally identifiable information) that do not appear in the materialized view definition. This data is automatically added to the underlying storage to support incremental refreshing of materialized views.\\n\\nBecause the underlying files of a materialized view might risk exposing data from upstream tables not part of the materialized view schema, Databricks recommends not sharing the underlying storage with untrusted downstream consumers.\\n\\nFor example, suppose the definition of a materialized view includes a `COUNT(DISTINCT field_a)` clause. Even though the materialized view definition only includes the aggregate `COUNT DISTINCT` clause, the underlying files will contain a list of the actual values of `field_a`.\\n\\n## Changes to existing functionality\\n\\nWhen Delta Live Tables is configured to persist data to Unity Catalog, the lifecycle of the table is managed by the Delta Live Tables pipeline. Because the pipeline manages the table lifecycle and permissions:\\n\\n* When a table is removed from the Delta Live Tables pipeline definition, the corresponding materialized view or streaming table entry is removed from Unity Catalog on the next pipeline update. The actual data is retained for a period of time so that it can be recovered if it was deleted by mistake. The data can be recovered by adding the materialized view or streaming table back into the pipeline definition.\\n* Deleting the Delta Live Tables pipeline results in deletion of all tables defined in that pipeline. Because of this change, the Delta Live Tables UI is updated to prompt you to confirm deletion of a pipeline.\\n* Internal backing tables, including backing tables used to support `APPLY CHANGES INTO`, are not directly accessible by users.\\n\\n## Write tables to Unity Catalog from a Delta Live Tables pipeline\\n\\nTo write your tables to Unity Catalog, when you [create a pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-pipelines.html#create-pipeline), select **Unity Catalog** under **Storage options**, select a catalog in the **Catalog** dropdown menu, and provide a database name in the **Target schema** field.\\n\\n## Ingest data into a Unity Catalog pipeline\\n\\nYour pipeline configured to use Unity Catalog can read data from:\\n\\n* Unity Catalog managed and external tables, views, materialized views and streaming tables.\\n* Hive metastore tables and views.\\n* Auto Loader using the `cloud_files()` function to read from Unity Catalog external locations.\\n* Apache Kafka and Amazon Kinesis.\\n\\nThe following are examples of reading from Unity Catalog and Hive metastore tables.\\n\\n### Batch ingestion from a Unity Catalog table\\n\\n```\\nCREATE OR REFRESH LIVE TABLE\\n table_name\\nAS SELECT\\n \\\\*\\nFROM\\n my_catalog.my_schema.table1;\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.table\\ndef table_name():\\n  return spark.table(\""my_catalog.my_schema.table\"")\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Stream changes from a Unity Catalog table\\n\\n```\\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE\\n table_name\\nAS SELECT\\n \\\\*\\nFROM\\n STREAM(my_catalog.my_schema.table1);\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.table\\ndef table_name():\\n  return spark.readStream.table(\""my_catalog.my_schema.table\"")\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Ingest data from Hive metastore\\n\\nA pipeline that uses Unity Catalog can read data from Hive metastore tables using the `hive_metastore` catalog:\\n\\n```\\nCREATE OR REFRESH LIVE TABLE\\n table_name\\nAS SELECT\\n \\\\*\\nFROM\\n hive_metastore.some_schema.table;\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.table\\ndef table3():\\n  return spark.table(\""hive_metastore.some_schema.table\"")\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Ingest data from Auto Loader\\n\\n```\\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE\\n table_name\\nAS SELECT\\n \\\\*\\nFROM\\n cloud_files(\\n <path-to-uc-external-location>,\\n \""json\""\\n )\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.table(table_properties={\""quality\"": \""bronze\""})\\ndef table_name():\\n  return (\\n     spark.readStream.format(\""cloudFiles\"")\\n     .option(\""cloudFiles.format\"", \""json\"")\\n     .load(f\""{path_to_uc_external_location}\"")\\n )\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Share materialized views (live tables)\\n\\nBy default, the tables created by a pipeline can be queried only by the pipeline owner. You can give other users the ability to query a table by using [GRANT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/security-grant.html) statements and you can revoke query access using [REVOKE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/security-revoke.html) statements.

For materialized views or streaming tables in a Unity Catalog-enabled pipeline, the Catalog Explorer lineage UI shows the upstream and downstream tables. Lineage is only displayed between tables defined in the pipeline; tables that are defined outside of the pipeline and read in the pipeline are not shown in the Catalog Explorer lineage UI. To learn more about Unity Catalog lineage, see [Capture and view data lineage with Unity Catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/data-lineage.html).\\n\\nFor a materialized view or streaming table in a Unity Catalog-enabled Delta Live Tables pipeline, the Catalog Explorer lineage UI will also link to the pipeline that produced the materialized view or streaming table if the pipeline is accessible from the current workspace.\\n\\n## Add, change, or delete data in a streaming table\\n\\nYou can use [data manipulation language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/index.html#dml-statements) (DML) statements, including insert, update, delete, and merge statements, to modify streaming tables published to Unity Catalog. Support for DML queries against streaming tables enables use cases such as updating tables for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance.\\n\\nNote\\n\\n* DML statements that modify the table schema of a streaming table are not supported. Ensure that your DML statements do not attempt to evolve the table schema.\\n* DML statements that update a streaming table can be run only in a shared Unity Catalog cluster or a SQL warehouse using Databricks Runtime 13.1 and above.\\n\\nThe following are examples of DML statements to modify records in a streaming table.\\n\\n### Delete records with a specific ID:\\n\\n```\\nDELETE FROM my_streaming_table WHERE id = 123;\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Update records with a specific ID:\\n\\n```\\nUPDATE my_streaming_table SET name = 'Jane Doe' WHERE id = 123;\\n\\n```\\n""

However, a single pipeline cannot write to both the Hive metastore and Unity Catalog and existing pipelines cannot be upgraded to use Unity Catalog. Your existing pipelines that do not use Unity Catalog are not affected by this preview, and will continue to persist data to the Hive metastore using the configured storage location.\\n\\nUnless specified otherwise in this document, all existing data sources and Delta Live Tables functionality are supported with pipelines that use Unity Catalog. Both the [Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html) and [SQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html) interfaces are supported with pipelines that use Unity Catalog.\\n\\nThe tables created in your pipeline can also be queried from shared Unity Catalog clusters using Databricks Runtime 13.1 and above or a SQL warehouse. Tables cannot be queried from assigned or no isolation clusters.\\n\\nTo manage permissions on the tables created by a Unity Catalog pipeline, use [GRANT and REVOKE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/index.html).\\n\\n## Requirements\\n\\nThe following are required to create tables in Unity Catalog from a Delta Live Tables pipeline:\\n\\n* Your pipeline must be configured to use the [preview channel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/properties.html#config-settings).\\n* You must have `USE CATALOG` privileges on the target catalog.\\n* You must have `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` and `USE SCHEMA` privileges in the target schema if your pipeline creates [materialized views](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/index.html#dlt-datasets).\\n* You must have `CREATE TABLE` and `USE SCHEMA` privileges in the target schema if your pipeline creates [streaming tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/index.html#dlt-datasets).\\n* If a target schema is not specified in the pipeline settings, you must have `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` or `CREATE TABLE` privileges on at least one schema in the target catalog.\\n\\n## Limitations\\n\\nThe following are limitations when using Unity Catalog with Delta Live Tables:\\n\\n* Existing pipelines that use the Hive metastore cannot be upgraded to use Unity Catalog. To migrate an existing pipeline that writes to Hive metastore, you must create a new pipeline and re-ingest data from the data source(s).\\n* You cannot create a Unity Catalog-enabled pipeline in a workspace attached to a metastore created during the Unity Catalog public preview. See [Upgrade to privilege inheritance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/upgrade-privilege-model.html).\\n* Init scripts, third-party libraries and JARs are not supported.\\n* Data manipulation language (DML) queries that modify the schema of a streaming table are not supported.\\n* A materialized view created in a Delta Live Tables pipeline cannot be used as a streaming source outside of that pipeline, for example, in another pipeline or in a downstream notebook.\\n* You cannot change the owner of a pipeline that uses Unity Catalog.\\n* Publishing to schemas that specify a managed storage location is not supported. All tables are stored in the catalog storage location if the target catalog specifies one, otherwise, they are stored in the metastore root storage location.\\n* The **History** tab in Catalog Explorer does not show history for streaming tables and materialized views.\\n* The `LOCATION` property is not supported when defining a table.\\n* Unity Catalog-enabled pipelines cannot publish to the Hive metastore.\\n* Python UDF support is in Private Preview. To have this feature enabled, contact your Databricks field engineering representative. When UDF support is enabled, to use Python UDFs in a pipeline you must add the `&quot;PythonUDF.enabled&quot;: &quot;true&quot;` custom cluster tag to both the default and maintenance clusters for the pipeline.\\n* You cannot use [Delta Sharing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-sharing/index.html) with a Delta Live Tables materialized view or streaming table published to Unity Catalog.\\n* You cannot use the `event log` [table valued function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log-with-uc) in a pipeline or query to access the event logs of multiple pipelines.\\n* You cannot share a view created over the `event_log` [table valued function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log-with-uc) with other users.\\n* Single-node clusters are not supported with Unity Catalog-enabled pipelines.

However, a single pipeline cannot write to both the Hive metastore and Unity Catalog and existing pipelines cannot be upgraded to use Unity Catalog. Your existing pipelines that do not use Unity Catalog are not affected by this preview, and will continue to persist data to the Hive metastore using the configured storage location.\\n\\nUnless specified otherwise in this document, all existing data sources and Delta Live Tables functionality are supported with pipelines that use Unity Catalog.

To migrate an existing pipeline that writes to Hive metastore, you must create a new pipeline and re-ingest data from the data source(s).\\n* You cannot create a Unity Catalog-enabled pipeline in a workspace attached to a metastore created during the Unity Catalog public preview. See [Upgrade to privilege inheritance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/upgrade-privilege-model.html).\\n* Init scripts, third-party libraries and JARs are not supported.\\n* Data manipulation language (DML) queries that modify the schema of a streaming table are not supported.\\n* A materialized view created in a Delta Live Tables pipeline cannot be used as a streaming source outside of that pipeline, for example, in another pipeline or in a downstream notebook.\\n* You cannot change the owner of a pipeline that uses Unity Catalog.\\n* Publishing to schemas that specify a managed storage location is not supported. All tables are stored in the catalog storage location if the target catalog specifies one, otherwise, they are stored in the metastore root storage location.\\n* The **History** tab in Catalog Explorer does not show history for streaming tables and materialized views.\\n* The `LOCATION` property is not supported when defining a table.\\n* Unity Catalog-enabled pipelines cannot publish to the Hive metastore.\\n* Python UDF support is in Private Preview. To have this feature enabled, contact your Databricks field engineering representative. When UDF support is enabled, to use Python UDFs in a pipeline you must add the `&quot;PythonUDF.enabled&quot;: &quot;true&quot;` custom cluster tag to both the default and maintenance clusters for the pipeline.\\n* You cannot use [Delta Sharing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-sharing/index.html) with a Delta Live Tables materialized view or streaming table published to Unity Catalog.\\n* You cannot use the `event log` [table valued function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log-with-uc) in a pipeline or query to access the event logs of multiple pipelines.\\n* You cannot share a view created over the `event_log` [table valued function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/observability.html#event-log-with-uc) with other users.\\n* Single-node clusters are not supported with Unity Catalog-enabled pipelines. Because Delta Live Tables might create a single-node cluster to run smaller pipelines, your pipeline might fail with an error message referencing `single-node mode`. If this occurs, make sure you specify at least one worker when you [Configure your compute settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/settings.html#cluster-config).\\n* Tables created in a Unity Catalog-enabled pipeline cannot be queried from assigned or no isolation clusters. To query tables created by a Delta Live Tables pipeline, you must use a shared cluster using Databricks Runtime 13.1 and above or a SQL warehouse.\\n* Delta Live Tables uses a shared cluster to run a Unity Catalog-enabled pipeline. A Unity Catalog-enabled pipeline cannot run on an assigned cluster.\\n\\nNote\\n\\nThe underlying files supporting materialized views might include data from upstream tables (including possible personally identifiable information) that do not appear in the materialized view definition. This data is automatically added to the underlying storage to support incremental refreshing of materialized views.\\n\\nBecause the underlying files of a materialized view might risk exposing data from upstream tables not part of the materialized view schema, Databricks recommends not sharing the underlying storage with untrusted downstream consumers.\\n\\nFor example, suppose the definition of a materialized view includes a `COUNT(DISTINCT field_a)` clause. Even though the materialized view definition only includes the aggregate `COUNT DISTINCT` clause, the underlying files will contain a list of the actual values of `field_a`.\\n\\n## Changes to existing functionality\\n\\nWhen Delta Live Tables is configured to persist data to Unity Catalog, the lifecycle of the table is managed by the Delta Live Tables pipeline. Because the pipeline manages the table lifecycle and permissions:\\n\\n* When a table is removed from the Delta Live Tables pipeline definition, the corresponding materialized view or streaming table entry is removed from Unity Catalog on the next pipeline update. The actual data is retained for a period of time so that it can be recovered if it was deleted by mistake. The data can be recovered by adding the materialized view or streaming table back into the pipeline definition.\\n* Deleting the Delta Live Tables pipeline results in deletion of all tables defined in that pipeline. Because of this change, the Delta Live Tables UI is updated to prompt you to confirm deletion of a pipeline.\\n* Internal backing tables, including backing tables used to support `APPLY CHANGES INTO`, are not directly accessible by users.\\n\\n## Write tables to Unity Catalog from a Delta Live Tables pipeline\\n\\nTo write your tables to Unity Catalog, when you [create a pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-pipelines.html#create-pipeline), select **Unity Catalog** under **Storage options**, select a catalog in the **Catalog** dropdown menu, and provide a database name in the **Target schema** field.\\n\\n## Ingest data into a Unity Catalog pipeline\\n\\nYour pipeline configured to use Unity Catalog can read data from:\\n\\n* Unity Catalog managed and external tables, views, materialized views and streaming tables.\\n* Hive metastore tables and views.\\n* Auto Loader using the `cloud_files()` function to read from Unity Catalog external locations.\\n* Apache Kafka and Amazon Kinesis.\\n\\nThe following are examples of reading from Unity Catalog and Hive metastore tables.\\n\\n### Batch ingestion from a Unity Catalog table\\n\\n```\\nCREATE OR REFRESH LIVE TABLE\\n table_name\\nAS SELECT\\n \\\\*\\nFROM\\n my_catalog.my_schema.table1;\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.table\\ndef table_name():\\n  return spark.table(\""my_catalog.my_schema.table\"")\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Stream changes from a Unity Catalog table\\n\\n```\\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE\\n table_name\\nAS SELECT\\n \\\\*\\nFROM\\n STREAM(my_catalog.my_schema.table1);\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.table\\ndef table_name():\\n  return spark.readStream.table(\""my_catalog.my_schema.table\"")\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Ingest data from Hive metastore\\n\\nA pipeline that uses Unity Catalog can read data from Hive metastore tables using the `hive_metastore` catalog:\\n\\n```\\nCREATE OR REFRESH LIVE TABLE\\n table_name\\nAS SELECT\\n \\\\*\\nFROM\\n hive_metastore.some_schema.table;\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.table\\ndef table3():\\n  return spark.table(\""hive_metastore.some_schema.table\"")\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Ingest data from Auto Loader\\n\\n```\\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE\\n table_name\\nAS SELECT\\n \\\\*\\nFROM\\n cloud_files(\\n <path-to-uc-external-location>,\\n \""json\""\\n )\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.table(table_properties={\""quality\"": \""bronze\""})\\ndef table_name():\\n  return (\\n     spark.readStream.format(\""cloudFiles\"")\\n     .option(\""cloudFiles.format\"", \""json\"")\\n     .load(f\""{path_to_uc_external_location}\"")\\n )\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Share materialized views (live tables)\\n\\nBy default, the tables created by a pipeline can be queried only by the pipeline owner. You can give other users the ability to query a table by using [GRANT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/security-grant.html) statements and you can revoke query access using [REVOKE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/security-revoke.html) statements. For more information about privileges in Unity Catalog, see [Manage privileges in Unity Catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/index.html).\\n\\n### Grant select on a table\\n\\n```\\nGRANT SELECT ON TABLE\\n my_catalog.my_schema.live_table\\nTO\\n REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@databricks.com`\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Revoke select on a table\\n\\n```\\nREVOKE SELECT ON TABLE\\n my_catalog.my_schema.live_table\\nFROM\\n REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@databricks.com`\\n\\n```\\n\\n## Grant create table or create materialized view privileges\\n\\n```\\nGRANT CREATE { MATERIALIZED VIEW | TABLE } ON SCHEMA\\n  my_catalog.my_schema\\nTO\\n  { principal | user }\\n\\n```\\n\\n## View lineage for a pipeline\\n\\nLineage for tables in a Delta Live Tables pipeline is visible in Catalog Explorer. For materialized views or streaming tables in a Unity Catalog-enabled pipeline, the Catalog Explorer lineage UI shows the upstream and downstream tables. Lineage is only displayed between tables defined in the pipeline; tables that are defined outside of the pipeline and read in the pipeline are not shown in the Catalog Explorer lineage UI. To learn more about Unity Catalog lineage, see [Capture and view data lineage with Unity Catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/data-lineage.html).\\n\\nFor a materialized view or streaming table in a Unity Catalog-enabled Delta Live Tables pipeline, the Catalog Explorer lineage UI will also link to the pipeline that produced the materialized view or streaming table if the pipeline is accessible from the current workspace.\\n\\n## Add, change, or delete data in a streaming table\\n\\nYou can use [data manipulation language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/index.html#dml-statements) (DML) statements, including insert, update, delete, and merge statements, to modify streaming tables published to Unity Catalog. Support for DML queries against streaming tables enables use cases such as updating tables for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance.\\n\\nNote\\n\\n* DML statements that modify the table schema of a streaming table are not supported. Ensure that your DML statements do not attempt to evolve the table schema.\\n* DML statements that update a streaming table can be run only in a shared Unity Catalog cluster or a SQL warehouse using Databricks Runtime 13.1 and above.\\n\\nThe following are examples of DML statements to modify records in a streaming table.\\n\\n### Delete records with a specific ID:\\n\\n```\\nDELETE FROM my_streaming_table WHERE id = 123;\\n\\n```\\n\\n### Update records with a specific ID:\\n\\n```\\nUPDATE my_streaming_table SET name = 'Jane Doe' WHERE id = 123;\\n\\n```\\n""

How to reference?,"To reference a secret in your notebook or job, you can use the Secrets utility (dbutils.secrets). Here's an example of how to use it:

```
# Get the secret value
dbutils.secrets.get(scope=""<scope-name>"", key=""<secret-name>"")
```

Replace `<scope-name>` with the name of your secret scope and `<secret-name>` with the name of your secret. This will return the value of the secret, which you can use in your code.

For more information on how to use the Secrets utility, you can refer to the following documentation: https://docs.databricks.com/security/secrets/secret-workflows.html#use-secrets-in-notebooks-and-jobs",https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/secrets/index,['databricks secrets reference'],"['# Secret management\n\nSometimes accessing data requires that you authenticate to external data sources through JDBC.\nInstead of directly entering your credentials into a notebook, use Azure Databricks secrets to store your\ncredentials and reference them in notebooks and jobs.

how can i create a sub folder in my database,"To create a subfolder in your database, you can use the `CREATE DATABASE` command with the `LOCATION` parameter to specify the path of the subfolder. Here's an example:

```
CREATE DATABASE my_database.my_subfolder
LOCATION '/mnt/my_mount_point/my_subfolder'
```

This creates a subfolder named `my_subfolder` inside the `my_database` database, with the location set to `/mnt/my_mount_point/my_subfolder`.

how can I import data from SharePoint,"You can import data from SharePoint using the Databricks SharePoint connector. The SharePoint connector is a custom connector that you can use to read data from SharePoint lists and document libraries. 

To use the SharePoint connector, you need to first create a SharePoint app registration and grant it permissions to access the SharePoint site and lists that you want to read data from. Once you have created the app registration and granted it permissions, you can use the SharePoint connector to read data from SharePoint lists and document libraries.

For more information about using the SharePoint connector, see the [Databricks SharePoint connector documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/data/data-sources/sharepoint/index.html).",https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/index,"['To import data from SharePoint into Databricks, you can use the SharePoint REST API to retrieve data in JSON format and then use the Databricks DataFrame API to read the JSON data into a DataFrame. You can find more information on how to import data from SharePoint into Databricks in the Databricks documentation: https://docs.databricks.com/data/data-sources/sharepointonline.html']","['# Interact with external data on Azure Databricks\n\nDatabricks Runtime provides bindings to popular data sources and formats to make importing and exporting data from the lakehouse simple. This article provides information to help you identify formats and integrations that have built-in support. You can also discover ways to extend Azure Databricks to interact with even more systems. Most data on Azure Databricks live in cloud object storage. See [Where’s my data?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/storage/index.html).\n\nAzure Databricks provides a number of optimizations for [data loading and ingestion](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/ingestion/index.html).\n\nAzure Databricks also supports query federation. See [Run queries using Lakehouse Federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/query-federation/index.html).\n\nIf you have not read or written data with Azure Databricks before, consider reviewing the DataFrames tutorial for [Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/getting-started/dataframes-python.html) or [Scala](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/getting-started/dataframes-scala.html). Even for users familiar with Apache Spark, this tutorial might address new challenges associated with accessing data in the cloud.\n\nPartner Connect provides optimized, easy-to-configure integrations to many enterprise solutions. See [What is Databricks Partner Connect?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/partner-connect/index.html).\n\n## What data formats can you use in Azure Databricks?\n\nAzure Databricks has built-in keyword bindings for all the data formats natively supported by Apache Spark. Azure Databricks uses Delta Lake as the default protocol for reading and writing data and tables, whereas Apache Spark uses Parquet.\n\nThe following data formats all have built-in keyword configurations in Apache Spark DataFrames and SQL:\n\n* [Delta Lake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/index.html)\n* [Delta Sharing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/deltasharing.html)\n* [Parquet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/parquet.html)\n* [ORC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/orc.html)\n* [JSON](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/json.html)\n* [CSV](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/csv.html)\n* [Avro](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/avro.html)\n* [Text](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/text.html)\n* [Binary](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/binary.html)\n\nAzure Databricks also provides a custom keyword for loading [MLflow experiments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/mlflow-experiment.html).\n\n## Work with streaming data sources on Azure Databricks\n\nAzure Databricks can integrate with stream messaging services for near-real time data ingestion into the Databricks Lakehouse. Azure Databricks can also sync enriched and transformed data in the lakehouse with other streaming systems.\n\nStructured Streaming provides native streaming access to file formats supported by Apache Spark, but Databricks recommends Auto Loader for most Structured Streaming operations that read data from cloud object storage. See [What is Auto Loader?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/ingestion/auto-loader/index.html).\n\nIngesting streaming messages to Delta Lake allows you to retain messages indefinitely, allowing you to replay data streams without fear of losing data due to retention thresholds.\n\nAzure Databricks has specific features for working with semi-structured data fields contained in Avro, protocol buffers, and JSON data payloads. To learn more, see:\n\n* [Transform Avro payload](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/avro-dataframe.html)\n* [Protocol buffers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/protocol-buffers.html)\n\nTo learn more about specific configurations for streaming from or to message queues, see:\n\n* [Kafka](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/kafka.html)\n* [Event Hubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/streaming-event-hubs.html)\n* [Azure Synapse with Structured Streaming](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/synapse.html)\n* [Pub/Sub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/pub-sub.html)\n\n## What data sources connect to Azure Databricks with JDBC?\n\nYou can use [JDBC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/jdbc.html) to connect with many data sources. Databricks Runtime includes drivers for a number of JDBC databases, but you might need to install a driver or different driver version to connect to your preferred database. Supported databases include the following:\n\n* [Query PostgreSQL with Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/postgresql.html)\n* [Query MySQL with Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/mysql.html)\n* [Query MariaDB with Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/mariadb.html)\n* [Query SQL Server with Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/sql-server.html)\n* [Use the Databricks connector to connect to another Databricks workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/databricks.html)\n\nYou may prefer Lakehouse Federation for managing queries to external database systems. See [Run queries using Lakehouse Federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/query-federation/index.html).\n\n## What data services does Azure Databricks integrate with?\n\nThe following data services require you to configure connection settings, security credentials, and networking settings. You might need administrator or power user privileges in your Azure account or Azure Databricks workspace. Some also require that you create an Azure Databricks [library](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/libraries/index.html) and install it in a cluster:\n\n* [Query data in Azure Synapse Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/synapse-analytics.html)\n* [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/cosmosdb-connector.html)\n* [MongoDB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/mongodb.html)\n* [Cassandra](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/cassandra.html)\n* [Couchbase](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/couchbase.html)\n* [ElasticSearch](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/elasticsearch.html)\n* [Read and write data from Snowflake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/snowflake.html)\n* [Google BigQuery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/bigquery.html)\n\nYou may prefer Lakehouse Federation for managing queries to external database systems. See [Run queries using Lakehouse Federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/query-federation/index.html).\n\n### Data formats with special considerations\n\nThe following data formats may require additional configuration or special considerations for use:\n\n* Databricks recommends loading [images](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/image.html) as `binary` data.\n* [XML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/xml.html) is not natively supported, but can be used after installing a library.\n* [Hive tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/hive-tables.html) are also natively supported by Apache Spark, but require configuration on Azure Databricks.\n* Azure Databricks can directly read many file formats while still compressed. You can also [unzip compressed files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/files/unzip-files.html) on Azure Databricks if necessary.\n* [LZO](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/lzo.html) requires a codec installation.\n\nFor more information about Apache Spark data sources, see [Generic Load/Save Functions](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-load-save-functions.html) and [Generic File Source Options](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-generic-options.html).\n']",['https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/index'],"[

See [What is Databricks Partner Connect?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/partner-connect/index.html).\n\n## What data formats can you use in Azure Databricks?\n\nAzure Databricks has built-in keyword bindings for all the data formats natively supported by Apache Spark. Azure Databricks uses Delta Lake as the default protocol for reading and writing data and tables, whereas Apache Spark uses Parquet.\n\nThe following data formats all have built-in keyword configurations in Apache Spark DataFrames and SQL:\n\n* [Delta Lake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/index.html)\n* [Delta Sharing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/deltasharing.html)\n* [Parquet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/parquet.html)\n* [ORC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/orc.html)\n* [JSON](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/json.html)\n* [CSV](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/csv.html)\n* [Avro](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/avro.html)\n* [Text](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/text.html)\n* [Binary](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/binary.html)\n\nAzure Databricks also provides a custom keyword for loading [MLflow experiments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/mlflow-experiment.html).\n\n## Work with streaming data sources on Azure Databricks\n\nAzure Databricks can integrate with stream messaging services for near-real time data ingestion into the Databricks Lakehouse. Azure Databricks can also sync enriched and transformed data in the lakehouse with other streaming systems.\n\nStructured Streaming provides native streaming access to file formats supported by Apache Spark, but Databricks recommends Auto Loader for most Structured Streaming operations that read data from cloud object storage. See [What is Auto Loader?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/ingestion/auto-loader/index.html).\n\nIngesting streaming messages to Delta Lake allows you to retain messages indefinitely, allowing you to replay data streams without fear of losing data due to retention thresholds.\n\nAzure Databricks has specific features for working with semi-structured data fields contained in Avro, protocol buffers, and JSON data payloads. To learn more, see:\n\n* [Transform Avro payload](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/avro-dataframe.html)\n* [Protocol buffers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/protocol-buffers.html)\n\nTo learn more about specific configurations for streaming from or to message queues, see:\n\n* [Kafka](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/kafka.html)\n* [Event Hubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/streaming-event-hubs.html)\n* [Azure Synapse with Structured Streaming](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/synapse.html)\n* [Pub/Sub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/pub-sub.html)\n\n## What data sources connect to Azure Databricks with JDBC?\n\nYou can use [JDBC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/jdbc.html) to connect with many data sources. Databricks Runtime includes drivers for a number of JDBC databases, but you might need to install a driver or different driver version to connect to your preferred database. Supported databases include the following:\n\n* [Query PostgreSQL with Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/postgresql.html)\n* [Query MySQL with Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/mysql.html)\n* [Query MariaDB with Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/mariadb.html)\n* [Query SQL Server with Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/sql-server.html)\n* [Use the Databricks connector to connect to another Databricks workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/databricks.html)\n\nYou may prefer Lakehouse Federation for managing queries to external database systems. See [Run queries using Lakehouse Federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/query-federation/index.html).\n\n## What data services does Azure Databricks integrate with?\n\nThe following data services require you to configure connection settings, security credentials, and networking settings. You might need administrator or power user privileges in your Azure account or Azure Databricks workspace. Some also require that you create an Azure Databricks [library](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/libraries/index.html) and install it in a cluster:\n\n* [Query data in Azure Synapse Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/synapse-analytics.html)\n* [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/cosmosdb-connector.html)\n* [MongoDB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/mongodb.html)\n* [Cassandra](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/cassandra.html)\n* [Couchbase](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/couchbase.html)\n* [ElasticSearch](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/elasticsearch.html)\n* [Read and write data from Snowflake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/snowflake.html)\n* [Google BigQuery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/bigquery.html)\n\nYou may prefer Lakehouse Federation for managing queries to external database systems. See [Run queries using Lakehouse Federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/query-federation/index.html).\n\n### Data formats with special considerations\n\nThe following data formats may require additional configuration or special considerations for use:\n\n* Databricks recommends loading [images](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/image.html) as `binary` data.\n* [XML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/xml.html) is not natively supported, but can be used after installing a library.\n* [Hive tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/hive-tables.html) are also natively supported by Apache Spark, but require configuration on Azure Databricks.\n* Azure Databricks can directly read many file formats while still compressed. You can also [unzip compressed files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/files/unzip-files.html) on Azure Databricks if necessary.\n* [LZO](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/lzo.html) requires a codec installation.\n\nFor more information about Apache Spark data sources, see [Generic Load/Save Functions](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-load-save-functions.html) and [Generic File Source Options](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-generic-options.html).\n""

This article provides information to help you identify formats and integrations that have built-in support. You can also discover ways to extend Azure Databricks to interact with even more systems. Most data on Azure Databricks live in cloud object storage. See [Where\u2019s my data?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/storage/index.html).\n\nAzure Databricks provides a number of optimizations for [data loading and ingestion](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/ingestion/index.html).\n\nAzure Databricks also supports query federation. See [Run queries using Lakehouse Federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/query-federation/index.html).\n\nIf you have not read or written data with Azure Databricks before, consider reviewing the DataFrames tutorial for [Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/getting-started/dataframes-python.html) or [Scala](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/getting-started/dataframes-scala.html). Even for users familiar with Apache Spark, this tutorial might address new challenges associated with accessing data in the cloud.\n\nPartner Connect provides optimized, easy-to-configure integrations to many enterprise solutions. See [What is Databricks Partner Connect?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/partner-connect/index.html).\n\n## What data formats can you use in Azure Databricks?\n\nAzure Databricks has built-in keyword bindings for all the data formats natively supported by Apache Spark. Azure Databricks uses Delta Lake as the default protocol for reading and writing data and tables, whereas Apache Spark uses Parquet.\n\nThe following data formats all have built-in keyword configurations in Apache Spark DataFrames and SQL:\n\n* [Delta Lake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/index.html)\n* [Delta Sharing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/deltasharing.html)\n* [Parquet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/parquet.html)\n* [ORC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/orc.html)\n* [JSON](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/json.html)\n* [CSV](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/csv.html)\n* [Avro](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/avro.html)\n* [Text](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/text.html)\n* [Binary](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/binary.html)\n\nAzure Databricks also provides a custom keyword for loading [MLflow experiments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/mlflow-experiment.html).\n\n## Work with streaming data sources on Azure Databricks\n\nAzure Databricks can integrate with stream messaging services for near-real time data ingestion into the Databricks Lakehouse. Azure Databricks can also sync enriched and transformed data in the lakehouse with other streaming systems.\n\nStructured Streaming provides native streaming access to file formats supported by Apache Spark, but Databricks recommends Auto Loader for most Structured Streaming operations that read data from cloud object storage. See [What is Auto Loader?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/ingestion/auto-loader/index.html).\n\nIngesting streaming messages to Delta Lake allows you to retain messages indefinitely, allowing you to replay data streams without fear of losing data due to retention thresholds.\n\nAzure Databricks has specific features for working with semi-structured data fields contained in Avro, protocol buffers, and JSON data payloads. To learn more, see:\n\n* [Transform Avro payload](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/avro-dataframe.html)\n* [Protocol buffers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/protocol-buffers.html)\n\nTo learn more about specific configurations for streaming from or to message queues, see:\n\n* [Kafka](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/kafka.html)\n* [Event Hubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/streaming-event-hubs.html)\n* [Azure Synapse with Structured Streaming](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/synapse.html)\n* [Pub/Sub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/structured-streaming/pub-sub.html)\n\n## What data sources connect to Azure Databricks with JDBC?\n\nYou can use [JDBC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/jdbc.html) to connect with many data sources. Databricks Runtime includes drivers for a number of JDBC databases, but you might need to install a driver or different driver version to connect to your preferred database. Supported databases include the following:\n\n* [Query PostgreSQL with Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/postgresql.html)\n* [Query MySQL with Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/mysql.html)\n* [Query MariaDB with Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/mariadb.html)\n* [Query SQL Server with Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/sql-server.html)\n* [Use the Databricks connector to connect to another Databricks workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/databricks.html)\n\nYou may prefer Lakehouse Federation for managing queries to external database systems. See [Run queries using Lakehouse Federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/query-federation/index.html).\n\n## What data services does Azure Databricks integrate with?\n\nThe following data services require you to configure connection settings, security credentials, and networking settings. You might need administrator or power user privileges in your Azure account or Azure Databricks workspace. Some also require that you create an Azure Databricks [library](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/libraries/index.html) and install it in a cluster:\n\n* [Query data in Azure Synapse Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/synapse-analytics.html)\n* [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/cosmosdb-connector.html)\n* [MongoDB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/mongodb.html)\n* [Cassandra](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/cassandra.html)\n* [Couchbase](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/couchbase.html)\n* [ElasticSearch](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/elasticsearch.html)\n* [Read and write data from Snowflake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/snowflake.html)\n* [Google BigQuery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/bigquery.html)\n\nYou may prefer Lakehouse Federation for managing queries to external database systems. See [Run queries using Lakehouse Federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/query-federation/index.html).\n\n### Data formats with special considerations\n\nThe following data formats may require additional configuration or special considerations for use:\n\n* Databricks recommends loading [images](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/image.html) as `binary` data.\n* [XML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/xml.html) is not natively supported, but can be used after installing a library.\n* [Hive tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/hive-tables.html) are also natively supported by Apache Spark, but require configuration on Azure Databricks.\n* Azure Databricks can directly read many file formats while still compressed. You can also [unzip compressed files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/files/unzip-files.html) on Azure Databricks if necessary.\n* [LZO](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/external-data/lzo.html) requires a codec installation.\n\nFor more information about Apache Spark data sources, see [Generic Load/Save Functions](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-load-save-functions.html) and [Generic File Source Options](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-generic-options.html).\n""

You define the transformations to perform on your data and Delta Live Tables manages task orchestration, cluster management, monitoring, data quality, and error handling.\n\nNote\n\nDelta Live Tables requires the [Premium plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/databricks/). Contact your Databricks account representative for more information.\n\nInstead of defining your data pipelines using a series of separate Apache Spark tasks, you define streaming tables and materialized views that the system should create and keep up to date. Delta Live Tables manages how your data is transformed based on queries you define for each processing step. You can also enforce data quality with Delta Live Tables *expectations*, which allow you to define expected data quality and specify how to handle records that fail those expectations.\n\nTo learn more about the benefits of building and running your ETL pipelines with Delta Live Tables, see the [Delta Live Tables product page](https://www.databricks.com/product/delta-live-tables).\n\n## What are Delta Live Tables datasets?\n\nDelta Live Tables datasets are the streaming tables, materialized views, and views maintained as the results of declarative queries. The following table describes how each dataset is processed:\n\n| Dataset type | How are records processed through defined queries? |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Streaming table |  Each record is processed exactly once. This assumes an append-only source. |\n|  Materialized views |  Records are processed as required to return accurate results for the current data state. Materialized views should be used for data sources with updates, deletions, or aggregations, and for change data capture processing (CDC). |\n|  Views |  Records are processed each time the view is queried. Use views for intermediate transformations and data quality checks that should not be published to public datasets. |\n\nThe following sections provide more detailed descriptions of each dataset type. To learn more about selecting dataset types to implement your data processing requirements, see [When to use views, materialized views, and streaming tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/transform.html#tables-vs-views).\n\n### Streaming table\n\nA *streaming table* is a Delta table with extra support for streaming or incremental data processing. Streaming tables allow you to process a growing dataset, handling each row only once. Because most datasets grow continuously over time, streaming tables are good for most ingestion workloads. Streaming tables are optimal for pipelines that require data freshness and low latency. Streaming tables can also be useful for massive scale transformations, as results can be incrementally calculated as new data arrives, keeping results up to date without needing to fully recompute all source data with each update. Streaming tables are designed for data sources that are append-only.\n\nNote\n\nAlthough, by default, streaming tables require append-only data sources, when a streaming source is another streaming table that requires updates or deletes, you can override this behavior with the [skipChangeCommits flag](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html#ignore-changes).\n\n### Materialized view\n\nA *materialized view* (or *live table*) is a view where the results have been precomputed. Materialized views are refreshed according to the update schedule of the pipeline in which they’re contained. Materialized views are powerful because they can handle any changes in the input. Each time the pipeline updates, query results are recalculated to reflect changes in upstream datasets that might have occurred because of compliance, corrections, aggregations, or general CDC. Delta Live Tables implements materialized views as Delta tables, but abstracts away complexities associated with efficient application of updates, allowing users to focus on writing queries.\n\n### Views\n\nAll *views* in Azure Databricks compute results from source datasets as they are queried, leveraging caching optimizations when available. Delta Live Tables does not publish views to the catalog, so views can be referenced only within the pipeline in which they are defined. Views are useful as intermediate queries that should not be exposed to end users or systems. Databricks recommends using views to enforce data quality constraints or transform and enrich datasets that drive multiple downstream queries.\n\n## Declare your first datasets in Delta Live Tables\n\nDelta Live Tables introduces new syntax for Python and SQL. To get started with Delta Live Tables syntax, use one of the following tutorials:\n\n* [Tutorial: Declare a data pipeline with SQL in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-sql.html)\n* [Tutorial: Declare a data pipeline with Python in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-python.html)\n\nNote\n\nDelta Live Tables separates dataset definitions from update processing, and Delta Live Tables notebooks are not intended for interactive execution. See [What is a Delta Live Tables pipeline?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/index#pipeline).\n\n## What is a Delta Live Tables pipeline?\n\nA *pipeline* is the main unit used to configure and run data processing workflows with Delta Live Tables.\n\nA pipeline contains materialized views and streaming tables declared in Python or SQL source files. Delta Live Tables infers the dependencies between these tables, ensuring updates occur in the correct order. For each dataset, Delta Live Tables compares the current state with the desired state and proceeds to create or update datasets using efficient processing methods.\n\nThe settings of Delta Live Tables pipelines fall into two broad categories:\n\n1. Configurations that define a collection of notebooks or files (known as *source code* or *libraries*) that use Delta Live Tables syntax to declare datasets.\n2. Configurations that control pipeline infrastructure, how updates are processed, and how tables are saved in the workspace.\n\nMost configurations are optional, but some require careful attention, especially when configuring production pipelines. These include the following:\n\n* To make data available outside the pipeline, you must declare a **target schema** to publish to the Hive metastore or a **target catalog** and **target schema** to publish to Unity Catalog.\n* Data access permissions are configured through the cluster used for execution. Make sure your cluster has appropriate permissions configured for data sources and the target **storage location**, if specified.\n\nFor details on using Python and SQL to write source code for pipelines, see [Delta Live Tables SQL language reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html) and [Delta Live Tables Python language reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html).\n\nFor more on pipeline settings and configurations, see [Configure pipeline settings for Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/settings.html).\n\n## Deploy your first pipeline and trigger updates\n\nBefore processing data with Delta Live Tables, you must configure a pipeline. Once a pipeline is configured, you can trigger an update to calculate results for each dataset in your pipeline. To get started using Delta Live Tables pipelines, see [Tutorial: Run your first Delta Live Tables pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-pipelines.html).\n\n## What is a pipeline update?\n\nPipelines deploy infrastructure and recompute data state when you start an *update*. An update does the following:\n\n* Starts a cluster with the correct configuration.\n* Discovers all the tables and views defined, and checks for any analysis errors such as invalid column names, missing dependencies, and syntax errors.\n* Creates or updates tables and views with the most recent data available.\n\nPipelines can be run continuously or on a schedule depending on your use case’s cost and latency requirements. See [Run an update on a Delta Live Tables pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/updates.html).\n\n## Ingest data with Delta Live Tables\n\nDelta Live Tables supports all data sources available in Azure Databricks.\n\nDatabricks recommends using streaming tables for most ingestion use cases. For files arriving in cloud object storage, Databricks recommends Auto Loader. You can directly ingest data with Delta Live Tables from most message buses.\n\nFor more information about configuring access to cloud storage, see [Cloud storage configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/settings.html#configure-cloud-storage).\n\nFor formats not supported by Auto Loader, you can use Python or SQL to query any format supported by Apache Spark. See [Load data with Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/load.html).\n\n## Monitor and enforce data quality\n\nYou can use *expectations* to specify data quality controls on the contents of a dataset. Unlike a `CHECK` constraint in a traditional database which prevents adding any records that fail the constraint, expectations provide flexibility when processing data that fails data quality requirements. This flexibility allows you to process and store data that you expect to be messy and data that must meet strict quality requirements. See [Manage data quality with Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/expectations.html).\n\n## How are Delta Live Tables and Delta Lake related?\n\nDelta Live Tables extends the functionality of Delta Lake. Because tables created and managed by Delta Live Tables are Delta tables, they have the same guarantees and features provided by Delta Lake. See [What is Delta Lake?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/index.html).\n\nDelta Live Tables adds several table properties in addition to the many table properties that can be set in Delta Lake. See [Delta Live Tables properties reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/properties.html) and [Delta table properties reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/table-properties.html).\n\n## How tables are created and managed by Delta Live Tables\n\nAzure Databricks automatically manages tables created with Delta Live Tables, determining how updates need to be processed to correctly compute the current state of a table and performing a number of maintenance and optimization tasks.\n\nFor most operations, you should allow Delta Live Tables to process all updates, inserts, and deletes to a target table. For details and limitations, see [Retain manual deletes or updates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/transform.html#manual-ddl).\n\n## Maintenance tasks performed by Delta Live Tables\n\nDelta Live Tables performs maintenance tasks within 24 hours of a table being updated. Maintenance can improve query performance and reduce cost by removing old versions of tables. By default, the system performs a full [OPTIMIZE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/delta-optimize.html) operation followed by [VACUUM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/delta-vacuum.html). You can disable OPTIMIZE for a table by setting `pipelines.autoOptimize.managed = false` in the [table properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/properties.html#table-properties) for the table. Maintenance tasks are performed only if a pipeline update has run in the 24 hours before the maintenance tasks are scheduled.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThe following limitations apply:\n\n* All tables created and updated by Delta Live Tables are Delta tables.\n* Delta Live Tables tables can only be defined once, meaning they can only be the target of a single operation in all Delta Live Tables pipelines.\n* Identity columns are not supported with tables that are the target of `APPLY CHANGES INTO` and might be recomputed during updates for materialized views. For this reason, Databricks recommends only using identity columns with streaming tables in Delta Live Tables. See [Use identity columns in Delta Lake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/generated-columns.html#identity).\n* An Azure Databricks workspace is limited to 100 concurrent pipeline updates.\n\n## Additional resources\n\n* Delta Live Tables has full support in the Databricks REST API. See [Delta Live Tables API guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/api-guide.html).\n* For pipeline and table settings, see [Delta Live Tables properties reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/properties.html).\n* [Delta Live Tables SQL language reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html).\n* [Delta Live Tables Python language reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html).\n']",['https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/index'],"[

                    ""content"": ""# What is Delta Live Tables?\n\nDelta Live Tables is a declarative framework for building reliable, maintainable, and testable data processing pipelines. You define the transformations to perform on your data and Delta Live Tables manages task orchestration, cluster management, monitoring, data quality, and error handling.\n\nNote\n\nDelta Live Tables requires the [Premium plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/databricks/). Contact your Databricks account representative for more information.\n\nInstead of defining your data pipelines using a series of separate Apache Spark tasks, you define streaming tables and materialized views that the system should create and keep up to date. Delta Live Tables manages how your data is transformed based on queries you define for each processing step. You can also enforce data quality with Delta Live Tables *expectations*, which allow you to define expected data quality and specify how to handle records that fail those expectations.\n\nTo learn more about the benefits of building and running your ETL pipelines with Delta Live Tables, see the [Delta Live Tables product page](https://www.databricks.com/product/delta-live-tables).\n\n## What are Delta Live Tables datasets?\n\nDelta Live Tables datasets are the streaming tables, materialized views, and views maintained as the results of declarative queries. The following table describes how each dataset is processed:\n\n| Dataset type | How are records processed through defined queries? |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Streaming table |  Each record is processed exactly once. This assumes an append-only source. |\n|  Materialized views |  Records are processed as required to return accurate results for the current data state. Materialized views should be used for data sources with updates, deletions, or aggregations, and for change data capture processing (CDC). |\n|  Views |  Records are processed each time the view is queried. Use views for intermediate transformations and data quality checks that should not be published to public datasets. |\n\nThe following sections provide more detailed descriptions of each dataset type. To learn more about selecting dataset types to implement your data processing requirements, see [When to use views, materialized views, and streaming tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/transform.html#tables-vs-views).\n\n### Streaming table\n\nA *streaming table* is a Delta table with extra support for streaming or incremental data processing. Streaming tables allow you to process a growing dataset, handling each row only once. Because most datasets grow continuously over time, streaming tables are good for most ingestion workloads. Streaming tables are optimal for pipelines that require data freshness and low latency. Streaming tables can also be useful for massive scale transformations, as results can be incrementally calculated as new data arrives, keeping results up to date without needing to fully recompute all source data with each update. Streaming tables are designed for data sources that are append-only.\n\nNote\n\nAlthough, by default, streaming tables require append-only data sources, when a streaming source is another streaming table that requires updates or deletes, you can override this behavior with the [skipChangeCommits flag](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html#ignore-changes).\n\n### Materialized view\n\nA *materialized view* (or *live table*) is a view where the results have been precomputed. Materialized views are refreshed according to the update schedule of the pipeline in which they\u2019re contained. Materialized views are powerful because they can handle any changes in the input. Each time the pipeline updates, query results are recalculated to reflect changes in upstream datasets that might have occurred because of compliance, corrections, aggregations, or general CDC. Delta Live Tables implements materialized views as Delta tables, but abstracts away complexities associated with efficient application of updates, allowing users to focus on writing queries.\n\n### Views\n\nAll *views* in Azure Databricks compute results from source datasets as they are queried, leveraging caching optimizations when available. Delta Live Tables does not publish views to the catalog, so views can be referenced only within the pipeline in which they are defined. Views are useful as intermediate queries that should not be exposed to end users or systems. Databricks recommends using views to enforce data quality constraints or transform and enrich datasets that drive multiple downstream queries.\n\n## Declare your first datasets in Delta Live Tables\n\nDelta Live Tables introduces new syntax for Python and SQL. To get started with Delta Live Tables syntax, use one of the following tutorials:\n\n* [Tutorial: Declare a data pipeline with SQL in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-sql.html)\n* [Tutorial: Declare a data pipeline with Python in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-python.html)\n\nNote\n\nDelta Live Tables separates dataset definitions from update processing, and Delta Live Tables notebooks are not intended for interactive execution. See [What is a Delta Live Tables pipeline?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/index#pipeline).\n\n## What is a Delta Live Tables pipeline?\n\nA *pipeline* is the main unit used to configure and run data processing workflows with Delta Live Tables.\n\nA pipeline contains materialized views and streaming tables declared in Python or SQL source files. Delta Live Tables infers the dependencies between these tables, ensuring updates occur in the correct order. For each dataset, Delta Live Tables compares the current state with the desired state and proceeds to create or update datasets using efficient processing methods.\n\nThe settings of Delta Live Tables pipelines fall into two broad categories:\n\n1. Configurations that define a collection of notebooks or files (known as *source code* or *libraries*) that use Delta Live Tables syntax to declare datasets.\n2. Configurations that control pipeline infrastructure, how updates are processed, and how tables are saved in the workspace.\n\nMost configurations are optional, but some require careful attention, especially when configuring production pipelines. These include the following:\n\n* To make data available outside the pipeline, you must declare a **target schema** to publish to the Hive metastore or a **target catalog** and **target schema** to publish to Unity Catalog.\n* Data access permissions are configured through the cluster used for execution. Make sure your cluster has appropriate permissions configured for data sources and the target **storage location**, if specified.\n\nFor details on using Python and SQL to write source code for pipelines, see [Delta Live Tables SQL language reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html) and [Delta Live Tables Python language reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html).\n\nFor more on pipeline settings and configurations, see [Configure pipeline settings for Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/settings.html).\n\n## Deploy your first pipeline and trigger updates\n\nBefore processing data with Delta Live Tables, you must configure a pipeline. Once a pipeline is configured, you can trigger an update to calculate results for each dataset in your pipeline. To get started using Delta Live Tables pipelines, see [Tutorial: Run your first Delta Live Tables pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-pipelines.html).\n\n## What is a pipeline update?\n\nPipelines deploy infrastructure and recompute data state when you start an *update*. An update does the following:\n\n* Starts a cluster with the correct configuration.\n* Discovers all the tables and views defined, and checks for any analysis errors such as invalid column names, missing dependencies, and syntax errors.\n* Creates or updates tables and views with the most recent data available.\n\nPipelines can be run continuously or on a schedule depending on your use case\u2019s cost and latency requirements. See [Run an update on a Delta Live Tables pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/updates.html).\n\n## Ingest data with Delta Live Tables\n\nDelta Live Tables supports all data sources available in Azure Databricks.\n\nDatabricks recommends using streaming tables for most ingestion use cases. For files arriving in cloud object storage, Databricks recommends Auto Loader. You can directly ingest data with Delta Live Tables from most message buses.\n\nFor more information about configuring access to cloud storage, see [Cloud storage configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/settings.html#configure-cloud-storage).\n\nFor formats not supported by Auto Loader, you can use Python or SQL to query any format supported by Apache Spark. See [Load data with Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/load.html).\n\n## Monitor and enforce data quality\n\nYou can use *expectations* to specify data quality controls on the contents of a dataset. Unlike a `CHECK` constraint in a traditional database which prevents adding any records that fail the constraint, expectations provide flexibility when processing data that fails data quality requirements. This flexibility allows you to process and store data that you expect to be messy and data that must meet strict quality requirements. See [Manage data quality with Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/expectations.html).\n\n## How are Delta Live Tables and Delta Lake related?\n\nDelta Live Tables extends the functionality of Delta Lake. Because tables created and managed by Delta Live Tables are Delta tables, they have the same guarantees and features provided by Delta Lake. See [What is Delta Lake?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/index.html).\n\nDelta Live Tables adds several table properties in addition to the many table properties that can be set in Delta Lake. See [Delta Live Tables properties reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/properties.html) and [Delta table properties reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/table-properties.html).\n\n## How tables are created and managed by Delta Live Tables\n\nAzure Databricks automatically manages tables created with Delta Live Tables, determining how updates need to be processed to correctly compute the current state of a table and performing a number of maintenance and optimization tasks.\n\nFor most operations, you should allow Delta Live Tables to process all updates, inserts, and deletes to a target table. For details and limitations, see [Retain manual deletes or updates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/transform.html#manual-ddl).\n\n## Maintenance tasks performed by Delta Live Tables\n\nDelta Live Tables performs maintenance tasks within 24 hours of a table being updated. Maintenance can improve query performance and reduce cost by removing old versions of tables. By default, the system performs a full [OPTIMIZE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/delta-optimize.html) operation followed by [VACUUM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/delta-vacuum.html). You can disable OPTIMIZE for a table by setting `pipelines.autoOptimize.managed = false` in the [table properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/properties.html#table-properties) for the table. Maintenance tasks are performed only if a pipeline update has run in the 24 hours before the maintenance tasks are scheduled.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThe following limitations apply:\n\n* All tables created and updated by Delta Live Tables are Delta tables.\n* Delta Live Tables tables can only be defined once, meaning they can only be the target of a single operation in all Delta Live Tables pipelines.\n* Identity columns are not supported with tables that are the target of `APPLY CHANGES INTO` and might be recomputed during updates for materialized views. For this reason, Databricks recommends only using identity columns with streaming tables in Delta Live Tables. See [Use identity columns in Delta Lake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/generated-columns.html#identity).\n* An Azure Databricks workspace is limited to 100 concurrent pipeline updates.\n\n## Additional resources\n\n* Delta Live Tables has full support in the Databricks REST API. See [Delta Live Tables API guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/api-guide.html).\n* For pipeline and table settings, see [Delta Live Tables properties reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/properties.html).\n* [Delta Live Tables SQL language reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html).\n* [Delta Live Tables Python language reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html).\n""

                    ""content"": ""# What is Delta Live Tables?\n\nDelta Live Tables is a declarative framework for building reliable, maintainable, and testable data processing pipelines. You define the transformations to perform on your data and Delta Live Tables manages task orchestration, cluster management, monitoring, data quality, and error handling.\n\nNote\n\nDelta Live Tables requires the [Premium plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/databricks/). Contact your Databricks account representative for more information.\n\nInstead of defining your data pipelines using a series of separate Apache Spark tasks, you define streaming tables and materialized views that the system should create and keep up to date. Delta Live Tables manages how your data is transformed based on queries you define for each processing step. You can also enforce data quality with Delta Live Tables *expectations*, which allow you to define expected data quality and specify how to handle records that fail those expectations.\n\nTo learn more about the benefits of building and running your ETL pipelines with Delta Live Tables, see the [Delta Live Tables product page](https://www.databricks.com/product/delta-live-tables).\n\n## What are Delta Live Tables datasets?\n\nDelta Live Tables datasets are the streaming tables, materialized views, and views maintained as the results of declarative queries. The following table describes how each dataset is processed:\n\n| Dataset type | How are records processed through defined queries? |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Streaming table |  Each record is processed exactly once. This assumes an append-only source. |\n|  Materialized views |  Records are processed as required to return accurate results for the current data state. Materialized views should be used for data sources with updates, deletions, or aggregations, and for change data capture processing (CDC). |\n|  Views |  Records are processed each time the view is queried. Use views for intermediate transformations and data quality checks that should not be published to public datasets. |\n\nThe following sections provide more detailed descriptions of each dataset type. To learn more about selecting dataset types to implement your data processing requirements, see [When to use views, materialized views, and streaming tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/transform.html#tables-vs-views).\n\n### Streaming table\n\nA *streaming table* is a Delta table with extra support for streaming or incremental data processing. Streaming tables allow you to process a growing dataset, handling each row only once. Because most datasets grow continuously over time, streaming tables are good for most ingestion workloads. Streaming tables are optimal for pipelines that require data freshness and low latency. Streaming tables can also be useful for massive scale transformations, as results can be incrementally calculated as new data arrives, keeping results up to date without needing to fully recompute all source data with each update. Streaming tables are designed for data sources that are append-only.\n\nNote\n\nAlthough, by default, streaming tables require append-only data sources, when a streaming source is another streaming table that requires updates or deletes, you can override this behavior with the [skipChangeCommits flag](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html#ignore-changes).\n\n### Materialized view\n\nA *materialized view* (or *live table*) is a view where the results have been precomputed. Materialized views are refreshed according to the update schedule of the pipeline in which they\u2019re contained. Materialized views are powerful because they can handle any changes in the input. Each time the pipeline updates, query results are recalculated to reflect changes in upstream datasets that might have occurred because of compliance, corrections, aggregations, or general CDC. Delta Live Tables implements materialized views as Delta tables, but abstracts away complexities associated with efficient application of updates, allowing users to focus on writing queries.\n\n### Views\n\nAll *views* in Azure Databricks compute results from source datasets as they are queried, leveraging caching optimizations when available. Delta Live Tables does not publish views to the catalog, so views can be referenced only within the pipeline in which they are defined. Views are useful as intermediate queries that should not be exposed to end users or systems. Databricks recommends using views to enforce data quality constraints or transform and enrich datasets that drive multiple downstream queries.\n\n## Declare your first datasets in Delta Live Tables\n\nDelta Live Tables introduces new syntax for Python and SQL. To get started with Delta Live Tables syntax, use one of the following tutorials:\n\n* [Tutorial: Declare a data pipeline with SQL in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-sql.html)\n* [Tutorial: Declare a data pipeline with Python in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-python.html)\n\nNote\n\nDelta Live Tables separates dataset definitions from update processing, and Delta Live Tables notebooks are not intended for interactive execution. See [What is a Delta Live Tables pipeline?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/index#pipeline).\n\n## What is a Delta Live Tables pipeline?\n\nA *pipeline* is the main unit used to configure and run data processing workflows with Delta Live Tables.\n\nA pipeline contains materialized views and streaming tables declared in Python or SQL source files. Delta Live Tables infers the dependencies between these tables, ensuring updates occur in the correct order. For each dataset, Delta Live Tables compares the current state with the desired state and proceeds to create or update datasets using efficient processing methods.\n\nThe settings of Delta Live Tables pipelines fall into two broad categories:\n\n1. Configurations that define a collection of notebooks or files (known as *source code* or *libraries*) that use Delta Live Tables syntax to declare datasets.\n2. Configurations that control pipeline infrastructure, how updates are processed, and how tables are saved in the workspace.\n\nMost configurations are optional, but some require careful attention, especially when configuring production pipelines. These include the following:\n\n* To make data available outside the pipeline, you must declare a **target schema** to publish to the Hive metastore or a **target catalog** and **target schema** to publish to Unity Catalog.\n* Data access permissions are configured through the cluster used for execution. Make sure your cluster has appropriate permissions configured for data sources and the target **storage location**, if specified.\n\nFor details on using Python and SQL to write source code for pipelines, see [Delta Live Tables SQL language reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html) and [Delta Live Tables Python language reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html).\n\nFor more on pipeline settings and configurations, see [Configure pipeline settings for Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/settings.html).\n\n## Deploy your first pipeline and trigger updates\n\nBefore processing data with Delta Live Tables, you must configure a pipeline. Once a pipeline is configured, you can trigger an update to calculate results for each dataset in your pipeline. To get started using Delta Live Tables pipelines, see [Tutorial: Run your first Delta Live Tables pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-pipelines.html).\n\n## What is a pipeline update?\n\nPipelines deploy infrastructure and recompute data state when you start an *update*. An update does the following:\n\n* Starts a cluster with the correct configuration.\n* Discovers all the tables and views defined, and checks for any analysis errors such as invalid column names, missing dependencies, and syntax errors.\n* Creates or updates tables and views with the most recent data available.\n\nPipelines can be run continuously or on a schedule depending on your use case\u2019s cost and latency requirements. See [Run an update on a Delta Live Tables pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/updates.html).\n\n## Ingest data with Delta Live Tables\n\nDelta Live Tables supports all data sources available in Azure Databricks.\n\nDatabricks recommends using streaming tables for most ingestion use cases. For files arriving in cloud object storage, Databricks recommends Auto Loader. You can directly ingest data with Delta Live Tables from most message buses.\n\nFor more information about configuring access to cloud storage, see [Cloud storage configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/settings.html#configure-cloud-storage).\n\nFor formats not supported by Auto Loader, you can use Python or SQL to query any format supported by Apache Spark. See [Load data with Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/load.html).\n\n## Monitor and enforce data quality\n\nYou can use *expectations* to specify data quality controls on the contents of a dataset. Unlike a `CHECK` constraint in a traditional database which prevents adding any records that fail the constraint, expectations provide flexibility when processing data that fails data quality requirements. This flexibility allows you to process and store data that you expect to be messy and data that must meet strict quality requirements. See [Manage data quality with Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/expectations.html).\n\n## How are Delta Live Tables and Delta Lake related?\n\nDelta Live Tables extends the functionality of Delta Lake. Because tables created and managed by Delta Live Tables are Delta tables, they have the same guarantees and features provided by Delta Lake. See [What is Delta Lake?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/index.html).\n\nDelta Live Tables adds several table properties in addition to the many table properties that can be set in Delta Lake. See [Delta Live Tables properties reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/properties.html) and [Delta table properties reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/table-properties.html).\n\n## How tables are created and managed by Delta Live Tables\n\nAzure Databricks automatically manages tables created with Delta Live Tables, determining how updates need to be processed to correctly compute the current state of a table and performing a number of maintenance and optimization tasks.\n\nFor most operations, you should allow Delta Live Tables to process all updates, inserts, and deletes to a target table. For details and limitations, see [Retain manual deletes or updates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/transform.html#manual-ddl).\n\n## Maintenance tasks performed by Delta Live Tables\n\nDelta Live Tables performs maintenance tasks within 24 hours of a table being updated. Maintenance can improve query performance and reduce cost by removing old versions of tables. By default, the system performs a full [OPTIMIZE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/delta-optimize.html) operation followed by [VACUUM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/delta-vacuum.html). You can disable OPTIMIZE for a table by setting `pipelines.autoOptimize.managed = false` in the [table properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/properties.html#table-properties) for the table. Maintenance tasks are performed only if a pipeline update has run in the 24 hours before the maintenance tasks are scheduled.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThe following limitations apply:\n\n* All tables created and updated by Delta Live Tables are Delta tables.\n* Delta Live Tables tables can only be defined once, meaning they can only be the target of a single operation in all Delta Live Tables pipelines.\n* Identity columns are not supported with tables that are the target of `APPLY CHANGES INTO` and might be recomputed during updates for materialized views. For this reason, Databricks recommends only using identity columns with streaming tables in Delta Live Tables. See [Use identity columns in Delta Lake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/generated-columns.html#identity).\n* An Azure Databricks workspace is limited to 100 concurrent pipeline updates.\n\n## Additional resources\n\n* Delta Live Tables has full support in the Databricks REST API. See [Delta Live Tables API guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/api-guide.html).\n* For pipeline and table settings, see [Delta Live Tables properties reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/properties.html).\n* [Delta Live Tables SQL language reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html).\n* [Delta Live Tables Python language reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html).\n""

Streaming tables can also be useful for massive scale transformations, as results can be incrementally calculated as new data arrives, keeping results up to date without needing to fully recompute all source data with each update. Streaming tables are designed for data sources that are append-only.\n\nNote\n\nAlthough, by default, streaming tables require append-only data sources, when a streaming source is another streaming table that requires updates or deletes, you can override this behavior with the [skipChangeCommits flag](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html#ignore-changes).\n\n### Materialized view\n\nA *materialized view* (or *live table*) is a view where the results have been precomputed. Materialized views are refreshed according to the update schedule of the pipeline in which they\u2019re contained. Materialized views are powerful because they can handle any changes in the input. Each time the pipeline updates, query results are recalculated to reflect changes in upstream datasets that might have occurred because of compliance, corrections, aggregations, or general CDC. Delta Live Tables implements materialized views as Delta tables, but abstracts away complexities associated with efficient application of updates, allowing users to focus on writing queries.\n\n### Views\n\nAll *views* in Azure Databricks compute results from source datasets as they are queried, leveraging caching optimizations when available. Delta Live Tables does not publish views to the catalog, so views can be referenced only within the pipeline in which they are defined. Views are useful as intermediate queries that should not be exposed to end users or systems. Databricks recommends using views to enforce data quality constraints or transform and enrich datasets that drive multiple downstream queries.\n\n## Declare your first datasets in Delta Live Tables\n\nDelta Live Tables introduces new syntax for Python and SQL. To get started with Delta Live Tables syntax, use one of the following tutorials:\n\n* [Tutorial: Declare a data pipeline with SQL in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-sql.html)\n* [Tutorial: Declare a data pipeline with Python in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-python.html)\n\nNote\n\nDelta Live Tables separates dataset definitions from update processing, and Delta Live Tables notebooks are not intended for interactive execution. See [What is a Delta Live Tables pipeline?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/index#pipeline).\n\n## What is a Delta Live Tables pipeline?\n\nA *pipeline* is the main unit used to configure and run data processing workflows with Delta Live Tables.\n\nA pipeline contains materialized views and streaming tables declared in Python or SQL source files. Delta Live Tables infers the dependencies between these tables, ensuring updates occur in the correct order. For each dataset, Delta Live Tables compares the current state with the desired state and proceeds to create or update datasets using efficient processing methods.\n\nThe settings of Delta Live Tables pipelines fall into two broad categories:\n\n1. Configurations that define a collection of notebooks or files (known as *source code* or *libraries*) that use Delta Live Tables syntax to declare datasets.\n2. Configurations that control pipeline infrastructure, how updates are processed, and how tables are saved in the workspace.\n\nMost configurations are optional, but some require careful attention, especially when configuring production pipelines. These include the following:\n\n* To make data available outside the pipeline, you must declare a **target schema** to publish to the Hive metastore or a **target catalog** and **target schema** to publish to Unity Catalog.\n* Data access permissions are configured through the cluster used for execution. Make sure your cluster has appropriate permissions configured for data sources and the target **storage location**, if specified.\n\nFor details on using Python and SQL to write source code for pipelines, see [Delta Live Tables SQL language reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html) and [Delta Live Tables Python language reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html).\n\nFor more on pipeline settings and configurations, see [Configure pipeline settings for Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/settings.html).\n\n## Deploy your first pipeline and trigger updates\n\nBefore processing data with Delta Live Tables, you must configure a pipeline. Once a pipeline is configured, you can trigger an update to calculate results for each dataset in your pipeline. To get started using Delta Live Tables pipelines, see [Tutorial: Run your first Delta Live Tables pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-pipelines.html).\n\n## What is a pipeline update?\n\nPipelines deploy infrastructure and recompute data state when you start an *update*. An update does the following:\n\n* Starts a cluster with the correct configuration.\n* Discovers all the tables and views defined, and checks for any analysis errors such as invalid column names, missing dependencies, and syntax errors.\n* Creates or updates tables and views with the most recent data available.\n\nPipelines can be run continuously or on a schedule depending on your use case\u2019s cost and latency requirements. See [Run an update on a Delta Live Tables pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/updates.html).\n\n## Ingest data with Delta Live Tables\n\nDelta Live Tables supports all data sources available in Azure Databricks.\n\nDatabricks recommends using streaming tables for most ingestion use cases. For files arriving in cloud object storage, Databricks recommends Auto Loader. You can directly ingest data with Delta Live Tables from most message buses.\n\nFor more information about configuring access to cloud storage, see [Cloud storage configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/settings.html#configure-cloud-storage).\n\nFor formats not supported by Auto Loader, you can use Python or SQL to query any format supported by Apache Spark. See [Load data with Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/load.html).\n\n## Monitor and enforce data quality\n\nYou can use *expectations* to specify data quality controls on the contents of a dataset. Unlike a `CHECK` constraint in a traditional database which prevents adding any records that fail the constraint, expectations provide flexibility when processing data that fails data quality requirements. This flexibility allows you to process and store data that you expect to be messy and data that must meet strict quality requirements. See [Manage data quality with Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/expectations.html).\n\n## How are Delta Live Tables and Delta Lake related?\n\nDelta Live Tables e\n````\n\nProvided context:\n - \n The user is viewing a page titled \""My queries\"" in the Databricks product.

oracle change data capture,"Delta Live Tables is a change data capture (CDC) solution for Databricks that allows you to update tables based on changes in source data. Delta Live Tables supports updating tables with slowly changing dimensions (SCD) type 1 and type 2. To perform CDC processing with Delta Live Tables, you first create a streaming table, and then use an `APPLY CHANGES INTO` statement to specify the source, keys, and sequencing for the change feed. For syntax details, see [Change data capture with SQL in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html#cdc) or [Change data capture with Python in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html#cdc).",https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/cdc,['Oracle Change Data Capture (CDC) is a feature of Oracle Database that enables capturing changes made to an Oracle database and making them available in a consumable format to other applications.

CDC is supported in the Delta Live Tables SQL and Python interfaces. Delta Live Tables supports updating tables with slowly changing dimensions (SCD) type 1 and type 2:\\n\\n* Use SCD type 1 to update records directly. History is not retained for records that are updated.\\n* Use SCD type 2 to retain a history of records, either on all updates or on updates to a specified set of columns. See [Track history for only specified columns with SCD type 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/cdc#type2-track-history)\\n\\nFor syntax and other references, see:\\n\\n* [Change data capture with Python in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html#cdc)\\n* [Change data capture with SQL in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html#cdc)\\n* [CDC table properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/properties.html#cdc)\\n\\nNote\\n\\nThis article describes how to update tables in your Delta Live Tables pipeline based on changes in source data. To learn how to record and query row-level change information for Delta tables, see [Use Delta Lake change data feed on Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/delta-change-data-feed.html).\\n\\n## How is CDC implemented with Delta Live Tables?\\n\\nYou must specify a column in the source data on which to sequence records, which Delta Live Tables interprets as a monotonically increasing representation of the proper ordering of the source data. Delta Live Tables automatically handles data that arrives out of order. For SCD Type 2 changes, Delta Live Tables propagates the appropriate sequencing values to the `__START_AT` and `__END_AT` columns of the target table. There should be one distinct update per key at each sequencing value, and NULL sequencing values are unsupported.\\n\\nTo perform CDC processing with Delta Live Tables, you first create a streaming table, and then use an `APPLY CHANGES INTO` statement to specify the source, keys, and sequencing for the change feed. To create the target streaming table, use the `CREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE` statement in SQL or the `create_streaming_table()` function in Python. To create the statement defining the CDC processing, use the `APPLY CHANGES` statement in SQL or the `apply_changes()` function in Python. For syntax details, see [Change data capture with SQL in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html#cdc) or [Change data capture with Python in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html#cdc).\\n\\n## What data objects are used for Delta Live Tables CDC processing?\\n\\nWhen you declare the target table in the Hive metastore, two data structures are created:\\n\\n* A view using the name assigned to the target table.\\n* An internal backing table used by Delta Live Tables to manage CDC processing. This table is named by prepending `__apply_changes_storage_` to the target table name.\\n\\nFor example, if you declare a target table named `dlt_cdc_target`, you will see a view named `dlt_cdc_target` and a table named `__apply_changes_storage_dlt_cdc_target` in the metastore. Creating a view allows Delta Live Tables to filter out the extra information (for example, tombstones and versions) required to handle out-of-order data. To view the processed data, query the target view. Because the schema of the `__apply_changes_storage_` table might change to support future features or enhancements, you should not query the table for production use. If you add data manually to the table, the records are assumed to come before other changes because the version columns are missing.\\n\\nIf a pipeline publishes to Unity Catalog, the internal backing tables are not accessible to users.\\n\\n## Limitations\\n\\n* Metrics for the target table, such as number of output rows, are not available.\\n\\n* SCD type 2 updates will add a history row for every input row, even if no columns have changed.\\n\\n* The target of the `APPLY CHANGES INTO` query or `apply_changes` function cannot be used as a source for a streaming table. A table that reads from the target of an `APPLY CHANGES INTO` query or `apply_changes` function must be a live table.\\n\\n* Expectations are not supported in an `APPLY CHANGES INTO` query or `apply_changes()` function. To use expectations for the source or target dataset:\\n\\n  + Add expectations on source data by defining an intermediate table with the required expectations and use this dataset as the source for the target table.\\n  + Add expectations on target data with a downstream table that reads input data from the target table.\\n\\n## SCD type 1 and SCD type 2 on Azure Databricks\\n\\nThe following sections provide examples that demonstrate Delta Live Tables SCD type 1 and type 2 queries that update target tables based on source events that:\\n\\n1. Create new user records.\\n2. Delete a user record.\\n3. Update user records. In the SCD type 1 example, the last `UPDATE` operations arrive late and are dropped from the target table, demonstrating the handling of out-of-order events.\\n\\nThe following examples assume familiarity with configuring and updating Delta Live Tables pipelines. See [Tutorial: Run your first Delta Live Tables pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-pipelines.html).\\n\\nTo run these examples, you must begin by creating a sample dataset. See [Generate test data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/cdc#generate-data).\\n\\nThe following are the input records for these examples:\\n\\n| userId | name | city | operation | sequenceNum |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  124 |  Raul |  Oaxaca |  INSERT |  1 |\\n|  123 |  Isabel |  Monterrey |  INSERT |  1 |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Tijuana |  INSERT |  2 |\\n|  126 |  Lily |  Cancun |  INSERT |  2 |\\n|  123 |  null |  null |  DELETE |  6 |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |  UPDATE |  6 |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Mexicali |  UPDATE |  5 |\\n|  123 |  Isabel |  Chihuahua |  UPDATE |  5 |\\n\\nIf you uncomment the final row in the example data, it will insert the following record that specifies where records should be truncated:\\n\\n| userId | name | city | operation | sequenceNum |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  null |  null |  null |  TRUNCATE |  3 |\\n\\nNote\\n\\nAll the following examples include options to specify both `DELETE` and `TRUNCATE` operations, but each of these are optional.\\n\\n## Process SCD type 1 updates\\n\\nThe following code example demonstrates processing SCD type 1 updates:\\n\\n```\\nimport dlt\\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, expr\\n\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.view\\ndef users():\\n  return spark.readStream.format(""delta"").table(""cdc_data.users"")\\n\\ndlt.create_streaming_table(""target"")\\n\\ndlt.apply_changes(\\n  target = ""target"",\\n  source = ""users"",\\n  keys = [""userId""],\\n  sequence_by = col(""sequenceNum""),\\n  apply_as_deletes = expr(""operation = \'DELETE\'""),\\n  apply_as_truncates = expr(""operation = \'TRUNCATE\'""),\\n  except_column_list = [""operation"", ""sequenceNum""],\\n  stored_as_scd_type = 1\\n)\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n-- Create and populate the target table.\\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE target;\\n\\nAPPLY CHANGES INTO\\n live.target\\nFROM\\n stream(cdc_data.users)\\nKEYS\\n (userId)\\nAPPLY AS DELETE WHEN\\n operation = ""DELETE""\\nAPPLY AS TRUNCATE WHEN\\n operation = ""TRUNCATE""\\nSEQUENCE BY\\n sequenceNum\\nCOLUMNS \\\\* EXCEPT\\n (operation, sequenceNum)\\nSTORED AS\\n SCD TYPE 1;\\n\\n```\\n\\nAfter running the SCD type 1 example, the target table contains the following records:\\n\\n| userId | name | city |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  124 |  Raul |  Oaxaca |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |\\n|  126 |  Lily |  Cancun |\\n\\nAfter running the SCD type 1 example with the additional `TRUNCATE` record, records `124` and `126` are truncated because of the `TRUNCATE` operation at `sequenceNum=3`, and the target table contains the following record:\\n\\n| userId | name | city |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |\\n\\n## Process SCD type 2 updates\\n\\nThe following code example demonstrates processing SCD type 2 updates:\\n\\n```\\nimport dlt\\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, expr\\n\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.view\\ndef users():\\n  return spark.readStream.format(""delta"").table(""cdc_data.users"")\\n\\ndlt.create_streaming_table(""target"")\\n\\ndlt.apply_changes(\\n  target = ""target"",\\n  source = ""users"",\\n  keys = [""userId""],\\n  sequence_by = col(""sequenceNum""),\\n  apply_as_deletes = expr(""operation = \'DELETE\'""),\\n  except_column_list = [""operation"", ""sequenceNum""],\\n  stored_as_scd_type = ""2""\\n)\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n-- Create and populate the target table.\\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE target;\\n\\nAPPLY CHANGES INTO\\n live.target\\nFROM\\n stream(cdc_data.users)\\nKEYS\\n (userId)\\nAPPLY AS DELETE WHEN\\n operation = ""DELETE""\\nSEQUENCE BY\\n sequenceNum\\nCOLUMNS \\\\* EXCEPT\\n (operation, sequenceNum)\\nSTORED AS\\n SCD TYPE 2;\\n\\n```\\n\\nAfter running the SCD type 2 example, the target table contains the following records:\\n\\n| userId | name | city | __START_AT | __END_AT |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  123 |  Isabel |  Monterrey |  1 |  5 |\\n|  123 |  Isabel |  Chihuahua |  5 |  6 |\\n|  124 |  Raul |  Oaxaca |  1 |  null |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Tijuana |  2 |  5 |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Mexicali |  5 |  6 |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |  6 |  null |\\n|  126 |  Lily |  Cancun |  2 |  null |\\n\\n## Track history for only specified columns with SCD type 2\\n\\nSCD type 2 supports specifying a subset of output columns to generate history on those columns only; changes to other columns are updated in place rather than generating new history records.\\n\\nTo use track history in Delta Live Tables SCD type 2, you must explicitly enable the feature in your pipeline by adding the following configuration to your Delta Live Tables pipeline settings:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n ""configuration"": {\\n ""pipelines.enableTrackHistory"": ""true""\\n }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nIf `pipelines.enableTrackHistory` is not set or set to `false`, SCD type 2 queries use the default behavior of generating a history record for every input row.\\n\\nThe following example demonstrates using track history with SCD type 2:\\n\\n```\\nimport dlt\\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, expr\\n\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.view\\ndef users():\\n  return spark.readStream.format(""delta"").table(""cdc_data.users"")\\n\\ndlt.create_streaming_table(""target"")\\n\\ndlt.apply_changes(\\n  target = ""target"",\\n  source = ""users"",\\n  keys = [""userId""],\\n  sequence_by = col(""sequenceNum""),\\n  apply_as_deletes = expr(""operation = \'DELETE\'""),\\n  except_column_list = [""operation"", ""sequenceNum""],\\n  stored_as_scd_type = ""2"",\\n  track_history_except_column_list = [""city""]\\n)\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n-- Create and populate the target table.\\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE target;\\n\\nAPPLY CHANGES INTO\\n live.target\\nFROM\\n stream(cdc_data.users)\\nKEYS\\n (userId)\\nAPPLY AS DELETE WHEN\\n operation = ""DELETE""\\nSEQUENCE BY\\n sequenceNum\\nCOLUMNS \\\\* EXCEPT\\n (operation, sequenceNum)\\nSTORED AS\\n SCD TYPE 2\\nTRACK HISTORY ON \\\\* EXCEPT\\n (city)\\n\\n```\\n\\nAfter running the SCD type 2 with track history example with the additional `TRUNCATE` record, the target table contains the following records:\\n\\n| userId | name | city | __START_AT | __END_AT |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  123 |  Isabel |  Chihuahua |  1 |  6 |\\n|  124 |  Raul |  Oaxaca |  1 |  null |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |  2 |  null |\\n|  126 |  Lily |  Cancun |  2 |  null |\\n\\n## Generate test data\\n\\nThe code below is provided to generate an example dataset for use in the example queries present in this tutorial.

CDC is supported in the Delta Live Tables SQL and Python interfaces. Delta Live Tables supports updating tables with slowly changing dimensions (SCD) type 1 and type 2:\\n\\n* Use SCD type 1 to update records directly. History is not retained for records that are updated.\\n* Use SCD type 2 to retain a history of records, either on all updates or on updates to a specified set of columns. See [Track history for only specified columns with SCD type 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/cdc#type2-track-history)\\n\\nFor syntax and other references, see:\\n\\n* [Change data capture with Python in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html#cdc)\\n* [Change data capture with SQL in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html#cdc)\\n* [CDC table properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/properties.html#cdc)\\n\\nNote\\n\\nThis article describes how to update tables in your Delta Live Tables pipeline based on changes in source data. To learn how to record and query row-level change information for Delta tables, see [Use Delta Lake change data feed on Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/delta-change-data-feed.html).\\n\\n## How is CDC implemented with Delta Live Tables?\\n\\nYou must specify a column in the source data on which to sequence records, which Delta Live Tables interprets as a monotonically increasing representation of the proper ordering of the source data. Delta Live Tables automatically handles data that arrives out of order. For SCD Type 2 changes, Delta Live Tables propagates the appropriate sequencing values to the `__START_AT` and `__END_AT` columns of the target table. There should be one distinct update per key at each sequencing value, and NULL sequencing values are unsupported.\\n\\nTo perform CDC processing with Delta Live Tables, you first create a streaming table, and then use an `APPLY CHANGES INTO` statement to specify the source, keys, and sequencing for the change feed. To create the target streaming table, use the `CREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE` statement in SQL or the `create_streaming_table()` function in Python. To create the statement defining the CDC processing, use the `APPLY CHANGES` statement in SQL or the `apply_changes()` function in Python. For syntax details, see [Change data capture with SQL in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html#cdc) or [Change data capture with Python in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html#cdc).\\n\\n## What data objects are used for Delta Live Tables CDC processing?\\n\\nWhen you declare the target table in the Hive metastore, two data structures are created:\\n\\n* A view using the name assigned to the target table.\\n* An internal backing table used by Delta Live Tables to manage CDC processing. This table is named by prepending `__apply_changes_storage_` to the target table name.\\n\\nFor example, if you declare a target table named `dlt_cdc_target`, you will see a view named `dlt_cdc_target` and a table named `__apply_changes_storage_dlt_cdc_target` in the metastore. Creating a view allows Delta Live Tables to filter out the extra information (for example, tombstones and versions) required to handle out-of-order data. To view the processed data, query the target view. Because the schema of the `__apply_changes_storage_` table might change to support future features or enhancements, you should not query the table for production use. If you add data manually to the table, the records are assumed to come before other changes because the version columns are missing.\\n\\nIf a pipeline publishes to Unity Catalog, the internal backing tables are not accessible to users.\\n\\n## Limitations\\n\\n* Metrics for the target table, such as number of output rows, are not available.\\n\\n* SCD type 2 updates will add a history row for every input row, even if no columns have changed.\\n\\n* The target of the `APPLY CHANGES INTO` query or `apply_changes` function cannot be used as a source for a streaming table. A table that reads from the target of an `APPLY CHANGES INTO` query or `apply_changes` function must be a live table.\\n\\n* Expectations are not supported in an `APPLY CHANGES INTO` query or `apply_changes()` function. To use expectations for the source or target dataset:\\n\\n  + Add expectations on source data by defining an intermediate table with the required expectations and use this dataset as the source for the target table.\\n  + Add expectations on target data with a downstream table that reads input data from the target table.\\n\\n## SCD type 1 and SCD type 2 on Azure Databricks\\n\\nThe following sections provide examples that demonstrate Delta Live Tables SCD type 1 and type 2 queries that update target tables based on source events that:\\n\\n1. Create new user records.\\n2. Delete a user record.\\n3. Update user records. In the SCD type 1 example, the last `UPDATE` operations arrive late and are dropped from the target table, demonstrating the handling of out-of-order events.\\n\\nThe following examples assume familiarity with configuring and updating Delta Live Tables pipelines. See [Tutorial: Run your first Delta Live Tables pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-pipelines.html).\\n\\nTo run these examples, you must begin by creating a sample dataset. See [Generate test data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/cdc#generate-data).\\n\\nThe following are the input records for these examples:\\n\\n| userId | name | city | operation | sequenceNum |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  124 |  Raul |  Oaxaca |  INSERT |  1 |\\n|  123 |  Isabel |  Monterrey |  INSERT |  1 |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Tijuana |  INSERT |  2 |\\n|  126 |  Lily |  Cancun |  INSERT |  2 |\\n|  123 |  null |  null |  DELETE |  6 |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |  UPDATE |  6 |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Mexicali |  UPDATE |  5 |\\n|  123 |  Isabel |  Chihuahua |  UPDATE |  5 |\\n\\nIf you uncomment the final row in the example data, it will insert the following record that specifies where records should be truncated:\\n\\n| userId | name | city | operation | sequenceNum |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  null |  null |  null |  TRUNCATE |  3 |\\n\\nNote\\n\\nAll the following examples include options to specify both `DELETE` and `TRUNCATE` operations, but each of these are optional.\\n\\n## Process SCD type 1 updates\\n\\nThe following code example demonstrates processing SCD type 1 updates:\\n\\n```\\nimport dlt\\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, expr\\n\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.view\\ndef users():\\n  return spark.readStream.format(\""delta\"").table(\""cdc_data.users\"")\\n\\ndlt.create_streaming_table(\""target\"")\\n\\ndlt.apply_changes(\\n  target = \""target\"",\\n  source = \""users\"",\\n  keys = [\""userId\""],\\n  sequence_by = col(\""sequenceNum\""),\\n  apply_as_deletes = expr(\""operation = 'DELETE'\""),\\n  apply_as_truncates = expr(\""operation = 'TRUNCATE'\""),\\n  except_column_list = [\""operation\"", \""sequenceNum\""],\\n  stored_as_scd_type = 1\\n)\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n-- Create and populate the target table.\\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE target;\\n\\nAPPLY CHANGES INTO\\n live.target\\nFROM\\n stream(cdc_data.users)\\nKEYS\\n (userId)\\nAPPLY AS DELETE WHEN\\n operation = \""DELETE\""\\nAPPLY AS TRUNCATE WHEN\\n operation = \""TRUNCATE\""\\nSEQUENCE BY\\n sequenceNum\\nCOLUMNS \\\\* EXCEPT\\n (operation, sequenceNum)\\nSTORED AS\\n SCD TYPE 1;\\n\\n```\\n\\nAfter running the SCD type 1 example, the target table contains the following records:\\n\\n| userId | name | city |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  124 |  Raul |  Oaxaca |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |\\n|  126 |  Lily |  Cancun |\\n\\nAfter running the SCD type 1 example with the additional `TRUNCATE` record, records `124` and `126` are truncated because of the `TRUNCATE` operation at `sequenceNum=3`, and the target table contains the following record:\\n\\n| userId | name | city |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |\\n\\n## Process SCD type 2 updates\\n\\nThe following code example demonstrates processing SCD type 2 updates:\\n\\n```\\nimport dlt\\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, expr\\n\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.view\\ndef users():\\n  return spark.readStream.format(\""delta\"").table(\""cdc_data.users\"")\\n\\ndlt.create_streaming_table(\""target\"")\\n\\ndlt.apply_changes(\\n  target = \""target\"",\\n  source = \""users\"",\\n  keys = [\""userId\""],\\n  sequence_by = col(\""sequenceNum\""),\\n  apply_as_deletes = expr(\""operation = 'DELETE'\""),\\n  except_column_list = [\""operation\"", \""sequenceNum\""],\\n  stored_as_scd_type = \""2\""\\n)\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n-- Create and populate the target table.\\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE target;\\n\\nAPPLY CHANGES INTO\\n live.target\\nFROM\\n stream(cdc_data.users)\\nKEYS\\n (userId)\\nAPPLY AS DELETE WHEN\\n operation = \""DELETE\""\\nSEQUENCE BY\\n sequenceNum\\nCOLUMNS \\\\* EXCEPT\\n (operation, sequenceNum)\\nSTORED AS\\n SCD TYPE 2;\\n\\n```\\n\\nAfter running the SCD type 2 example, the target table contains the following records:\\n\\n| userId | name | city | __START_AT | __END_AT |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  123 |  Isabel |  Monterrey |  1 |  5 |\\n|  123 |  Isabel |  Chihuahua |  5 |  6 |\\n|  124 |  Raul |  Oaxaca |  1 |  null |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Tijuana |  2 |  5 |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Mexicali |  5 |  6 |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |  6 |  null |\\n|  126 |  Lily |  Cancun |  2 |  null |\\n\\n## Track history for only specified columns with SCD type 2\\n\\nSCD type 2 supports specifying a subset of output columns to generate history on those columns only; changes to other columns are updated in place rather than generating new history records.\\n\\nTo use track history in Delta Live Tables SCD type 2, you must explicitly enable the feature in your pipeline by adding the following configuration to your Delta Live Tables pipeline settings:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n \""configuration\"": {\\n \""pipelines.enableTrackHistory\"": \""true\""\\n }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nIf `pipelines.enableTrackHistory` is not set or set to `false`, SCD type 2 queries use the default behavior of generating a history record for every input row.\\n\\nThe following example demonstrates using track history with SCD type 2:\\n\\n```\\nimport dlt\\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, expr\\n\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.view\\ndef users():\\n  return spark.readStream.format(\""delta\"").table(\""cdc_data.users\"")\\n\\ndlt.create_streaming_table(\""target\"")\\n\\ndlt.apply_changes(\\n  target = \""target\"",\\n  source = \""users\"",\\n  keys = [\""userId\""],\\n  sequence_by = col(\""sequenceNum\""),\\n  apply_as_deletes = expr(\""operation = 'DELETE'\""),\\n  except_column_list = [\""operation\"", \""sequenceNum\""],\\n  stored_as_scd_type = \""2\"",\\n  track_history_except_column_list = [\""city\""]\\n)\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n-- Create and populate the target table.\\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE target;\\n\\nAPPLY CHANGES INTO\\n live.target\\nFROM\\n stream(cdc_data.users)\\nKEYS\\n (userId)\\nAPPLY AS DELETE WHEN\\n operation = \""DELETE\""\\nSEQUENCE BY\\n sequenceNum\\nCOLUMNS \\\\* EXCEPT\\n (operation, sequenceNum)\\nSTORED AS\\n SCD TYPE 2\\nTRACK HISTORY ON \\\\* EXCEPT\\n (city)\\n\\n```\\n\\nAfter running the SCD type 2 with track history example with the additional `TRUNCATE` record, the target table contains the following records:\\n\\n| userId | name | city | __START_AT | __END_AT |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  123 |  Isabel |  Chihuahua |  1 |  6 |\\n|  124 |  Raul |  Oaxaca |  1 |  null |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |  2 |  null |\\n|  126 |  Lily |  Cancun |  2 |  null |\\n\\n## Generate test data\\n\\nThe code below is provided to generate an example dataset for use in the example queries present in this tutorial.

CDC is supported in the Delta Live Tables SQL and Python interfaces. Delta Live Tables supports updating tables with slowly changing dimensions (SCD) type 1 and type 2:\\n\\n* Use SCD type 1 to update records directly. History is not retained for records that are updated.\\n* Use SCD type 2 to retain a history of records, either on all updates or on updates to a specified set of columns. See [Track history for only specified columns with SCD type 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/cdc#type2-track-history)\\n\\nFor syntax and other references, see:\\n\\n* [Change data capture with Python in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html#cdc)\\n* [Change data capture with SQL in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html#cdc)\\n* [CDC table properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/properties.html#cdc)\\n\\nNote\\n\\nThis article describes how to update tables in your Delta Live Tables pipeline based on changes in source data. To learn how to record and query row-level change information for Delta tables, see [Use Delta Lake change data feed on Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/delta-change-data-feed.html).\\n\\n## How is CDC implemented with Delta Live Tables?\\n\\nYou must specify a column in the source data on which to sequence records, which Delta Live Tables interprets as a monotonically increasing representation of the proper ordering of the source data. Delta Live Tables automatically handles data that arrives out of order. For SCD Type 2 changes, Delta Live Tables propagates the appropriate sequencing values to the `__START_AT` and `__END_AT` columns of the target table. There should be one distinct update per key at each sequencing value, and NULL sequencing values are unsupported.\\n\\nTo perform CDC processing with Delta Live Tables, you first create a streaming table, and then use an `APPLY CHANGES INTO` statement to specify the source, keys, and sequencing for the change feed. To create the target streaming table, use the `CREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE` statement in SQL or the `create_streaming_table()` function in Python. To create the statement defining the CDC processing, use the `APPLY CHANGES` statement in SQL or the `apply_changes()` function in Python. For syntax details, see [Change data capture with SQL in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html#cdc) or [Change data capture with Python in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html#cdc).\\n\\n## What data objects are used for Delta Live Tables CDC processing?\\n\\nWhen you declare the target table in the Hive metastore, two data structures are created:\\n\\n* A view using the name assigned to the target table.\\n* An internal backing table used by Delta Live Tables to manage CDC processing. This table is named by prepending `__apply_changes_storage_` to the target table name.\\n\\nFor example, if you declare a target table named `dlt_cdc_target`, you will see a view named `dlt_cdc_target` and a table named `__apply_changes_storage_dlt_cdc_target` in the metastore. Creating a view allows Delta Live Tables to filter out the extra information (for example, tombstones and versions) required to handle out-of-order data. To view the processed data, query the target view. Because the schema of the `__apply_changes_storage_` table might change to support future features or enhancements, you should not query the table for production use. If you add data manually to the table, the records are assumed to come before other changes because the version columns are missing.\\n\\nIf a pipeline publishes to Unity Catalog, the internal backing tables are not accessible to users.\\n\\n## Limitations\\n\\n* Metrics for the target table, such as number of output rows, are not available.\\n\\n* SCD type 2 updates will add a history row for every input row, even if no columns have changed.\\n\\n* The target of the `APPLY CHANGES INTO` query or `apply_changes` function cannot be used as a source for a streaming table. A table that reads from the target of an `APPLY CHANGES INTO` query or `apply_changes` function must be a live table.\\n\\n* Expectations are not supported in an `APPLY CHANGES INTO` query or `apply_changes()` function. To use expectations for the source or target dataset:\\n\\n  + Add expectations on source data by defining an intermediate table with the required expectations and use this dataset as the source for the target table.\\n  + Add expectations on target data with a downstream table that reads input data from the target table.\\n\\n## SCD type 1 and SCD type 2 on Azure Databricks\\n\\nThe following sections provide examples that demonstrate Delta Live Tables SCD type 1 and type 2 queries that update target tables based on source events that:\\n\\n1. Create new user records.\\n2. Delete a user record.\\n3. Update user records. In the SCD type 1 example, the last `UPDATE` operations arrive late and are dropped from the target table, demonstrating the handling of out-of-order events.\\n\\nThe following examples assume familiarity with configuring and updating Delta Live Tables pipelines. See [Tutorial: Run your first Delta Live Tables pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-pipelines.html).\\n\\nTo run these examples, you must begin by creating a sample dataset. See [Generate test data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/cdc#generate-data).\\n\\nThe following are the input records for these examples:\\n\\n userId | name | city | operation | sequenceNum |\\n --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n  124 |  Raul |  Oaxaca |  INSERT |  1 |\\n  123 |  Isabel |  Monterrey |  INSERT |  1 |\\n  125 |  Mercedes |  Tijuana |  INSERT |  2 |\\n  126 |  Lily |  Cancun |  INSERT |  2 |\\n  123 |  null |  null |  DELETE |  6 |\\n  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |  UPDATE |  6 |\\n  125 |  Mercedes |  Mexicali |  UPDATE |  5 |\\n  123 |  Isabel |  Chihuahua |  UPDATE |  5 |\\n\\nIf you uncomment the final row in the example data, it will insert the following record that specifies where records should be truncated:\\n\\n userId | name | city | operation | sequenceNum |\\n --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n  null |  null |  null |  TRUNCATE |  3 |\\n\\nNote\\n\\nAll the following examples include options to specify both `DELETE` and `TRUNCATE` operations, but each of these are optional.\\n\\n## Process SCD type 1 updates\\n\\nThe following code example demonstrates processing SCD type 1 updates:\\n\\n```\\nimport dlt\\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, expr\\n\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.view\\ndef users():\\n  return spark.readStream.format(\""delta\"").table(\""cdc_data.users\"")\\n\\ndlt.create_streaming_table(\""target\"")\\n\\ndlt.apply_changes(\\n  target = \""target\"",\\n  source = \""users\"",\\n  keys = [\""userId\""],\\n  sequence_by = col(\""sequenceNum\""),\\n  apply_as_deletes = expr(\""operation = 'DELETE'\""),\\n  apply_as_truncates = expr(\""operation = 'TRUNCATE'\""),\\n  except_column_list = [\""operation\"", \""sequenceNum\""],\\n  stored_as_scd_type = 1\\n)\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n-- Create and populate the target table.\\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE target;\\n\\nAPPLY CHANGES INTO\\n live.target\\nFROM\\n stream(cdc_data.users)\\nKEYS\\n (userId)\\nAPPLY AS DELETE WHEN\\n operation = \""DELETE\""\\nAPPLY AS TRUNCATE WHEN\\n operation = \""TRUNCATE\""\\nSEQUENCE BY\\n sequenceNum\\nCOLUMNS \\\\* EXCEPT\\n (operation, sequenceNum)\\nSTORED AS\\n SCD TYPE 1;\\n\\n```\\n\\nAfter running the SCD type 1 example, the target table contains the following records:\\n\\n userId | name | city |\\n --- | --- | --- |\\n  124 |  Raul |  Oaxaca |\\n  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |\\n  126 |  Lily |  Cancun |\\n\\nAfter running the SCD type 1 example with the additional `TRUNCATE` record, records `124` and `126` are truncated because of the `TRUNCATE` operation at `sequenceNum=3`, and the target table contains the following record:\\n\\n userId | name | city |\\n --- | --- | --- |\\n  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |\\n\\n## Process SCD type 2 updates\\n\\nThe following code example demonstrates processing SCD type 2 updates:\\n\\n```\\nimport dlt\\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, expr\\n\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.view\\ndef users():\\n  return spark.readStream.format(\""delta\"").table(\""cdc_data.users\"")\\n\\ndlt.create_streaming_table(\""target\"")\\n\\ndlt.apply_changes(\\n  target = \""target\"",\\n  source = \""users\"",\\n  keys = [\""userId\""],\\n  sequence_by = col(\""sequenceNum\""),\\n  apply_as_deletes = expr(\""operation = 'DELETE'\""),\\n  except_column_list = [\""operation\"", \""sequenceNum\""],\\n  stored_as_scd_type = \""2\""\\n)\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n-- Create and populate the target table.\\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE target;\\n\\nAPPLY CHANGES INTO\\n live.target\\nFROM\\n stream(cdc_data.users)\\nKEYS\\n (userId)\\nAPPLY AS DELETE WHEN\\n operation = \""DELETE\""\\nSEQUENCE BY\\n sequenceNum\\nCOLUMNS \\\\* EXCEPT\\n (operation, sequenceNum)\\nSTORED AS\\n SCD TYPE 2;\\n\\n```\\n\\nAfter running the SCD type 2 example, the target table contains the following records:\\n\\n userId | name | city | __START_AT | __END_AT |\\n --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n  123 |  Isabel |  Monterrey |  1 |  5 |\\n  123 |  Isabel |  Chihuahua |  5 |  6 |\\n  124 |  Raul |  Oaxaca |  1 |  null |\\n  125 |  Mercedes |  Tijuana |  2 |  5 |\\n  125 |  Mercedes |  Mexicali |  5 |  6 |\\n  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |  6 |  null |\\n  126 |  Lily |  Cancun |  2 |  null |\\n\\n## Track history for only specified columns with SCD type 2\\n\\nSCD type 2 supports specifying a subset of output columns to generate history on those columns only; changes to other columns are updated in place rather than generating new history records.\\n\\nTo use track history in Delta Live Tables SCD type 2, you must explicitly enable the fea\\n````\\n\\nProvided context:\\n - \\n The user is viewing a page titled \""Tania's JMS Sample data Notebook 2023-09-26 10:32:41 - Databricks\"" in the Databricks product.

CDC is supported in the Delta Live Tables SQL and Python interfaces. Delta Live Tables supports updating tables with slowly changing dimensions (SCD) type 1 and type 2:\\n\\n* Use SCD type 1 to update records directly. History is not retained for records that are updated.\\n* Use SCD type 2 to retain a history of records, either on all updates or on updates to a specified set of columns. See [Track history for only specified columns with SCD type 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/cdc#type2-track-history)\\n\\nFor syntax and other references, see:\\n\\n* [Change data capture with Python in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html#cdc)\\n* [Change data capture with SQL in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html#cdc)\\n* [CDC table properties](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/properties.html#cdc)\\n\\nNote\\n\\nThis article describes how to update tables in your Delta Live Tables pipeline based on changes in source data. To learn how to record and query row-level change information for Delta tables, see [Use Delta Lake change data feed on Azure Databricks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta/delta-change-data-feed.html).\\n\\n## How is CDC implemented with Delta Live Tables?\\n\\nYou must specify a column in the source data on which to sequence records, which Delta Live Tables interprets as a monotonically increasing representation of the proper ordering of the source data. Delta Live Tables automatically handles data that arrives out of order. For SCD Type 2 changes, Delta Live Tables propagates the appropriate sequencing values to the `__START_AT` and `__END_AT` columns of the target table. There should be one distinct update per key at each sequencing value, and NULL sequencing values are unsupported.\\n\\nTo perform CDC processing with Delta Live Tables, you first create a streaming table, and then use an `APPLY CHANGES INTO` statement to specify the source, keys, and sequencing for the change feed. To create the target streaming table, use the `CREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE` statement in SQL or the `create_streaming_table()` function in Python. To create the statement defining the CDC processing, use the `APPLY CHANGES` statement in SQL or the `apply_changes()` function in Python. For syntax details, see [Change data capture with SQL in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html#cdc) or [Change data capture with Python in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html#cdc).\\n\\n## What data objects are used for Delta Live Tables CDC processing?\\n\\nWhen you declare the target table in the Hive metastore, two data structures are created:\\n\\n* A view using the name assigned to the target table.\\n* An internal backing table used by Delta Live Tables to manage CDC processing. This table is named by prepending `__apply_changes_storage_` to the target table name.\\n\\nFor example, if you declare a target table named `dlt_cdc_target`, you will see a view named `dlt_cdc_target` and a table named `__apply_changes_storage_dlt_cdc_target` in the metastore. Creating a view allows Delta Live Tables to filter out the extra information (for example, tombstones and versions) required to handle out-of-order data. To view the processed data, query the target view. Because the schema of the `__apply_changes_storage_` table might change to support future features or enhancements, you should not query the table for production use. If you add data manually to the table, the records are assumed to come before other changes because the version columns are missing.\\n\\nIf a pipeline publishes to Unity Catalog, the internal backing tables are not accessible to users.\\n\\n## Limitations\\n\\n* Metrics for the target table, such as number of output rows, are not available.\\n\\n* SCD type 2 updates will add a history row for every input row, even if no columns have changed.\\n\\n* The target of the `APPLY CHANGES INTO` query or `apply_changes` function cannot be used as a source for a streaming table. A table that reads from the target of an `APPLY CHANGES INTO` query or `apply_changes` function must be a live table.\\n\\n* Expectations are not supported in an `APPLY CHANGES INTO` query or `apply_changes()` function. To use expectations for the source or target dataset:\\n\\n  + Add expectations on source data by defining an intermediate table with the required expectations and use this dataset as the source for the target table.\\n  + Add expectations on target data with a downstream table that reads input data from the target table.\\n\\n## SCD type 1 and SCD type 2 on Azure Databricks\\n\\nThe following sections provide examples that demonstrate Delta Live Tables SCD type 1 and type 2 queries that update target tables based on source events that:\\n\\n1. Create new user records.\\n2. Delete a user record.\\n3. Update user records. In the SCD type 1 example, the last `UPDATE` operations arrive late and are dropped from the target table, demonstrating the handling of out-of-order events.\\n\\nThe following examples assume familiarity with configuring and updating Delta Live Tables pipelines. See [Tutorial: Run your first Delta Live Tables pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/tutorial-pipelines.html).\\n\\nTo run these examples, you must begin by creating a sample dataset. See [Generate test data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/cdc#generate-data).\\n\\nThe following are the input records for these examples:\\n\\n| userId | name | city | operation | sequenceNum |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  124 |  Raul |  Oaxaca |  INSERT |  1 |\\n|  123 |  Isabel |  Monterrey |  INSERT |  1 |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Tijuana |  INSERT |  2 |\\n|  126 |  Lily |  Cancun |  INSERT |  2 |\\n|  123 |  null |  null |  DELETE |  6 |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |  UPDATE |  6 |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Mexicali |  UPDATE |  5 |\\n|  123 |  Isabel |  Chihuahua |  UPDATE |  5 |\\n\\nIf you uncomment the final row in the example data, it will insert the following record that specifies where records should be truncated:\\n\\n| userId | name | city | operation | sequenceNum |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  null |  null |  null |  TRUNCATE |  3 |\\n\\nNote\\n\\nAll the following examples include options to specify both `DELETE` and `TRUNCATE` operations, but each of these are optional.\\n\\n## Process SCD type 1 updates\\n\\nThe following code example demonstrates processing SCD type 1 updates:\\n\\n```\\nimport dlt\\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, expr\\n\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.view\\ndef users():\\n  return spark.readStream.format(\""delta\"").table(\""cdc_data.users\"")\\n\\ndlt.create_streaming_table(\""target\"")\\n\\ndlt.apply_changes(\\n  target = \""target\"",\\n  source = \""users\"",\\n  keys = [\""userId\""],\\n  sequence_by = col(\""sequenceNum\""),\\n  apply_as_deletes = expr(\""operation = 'DELETE'\""),\\n  apply_as_truncates = expr(\""operation = 'TRUNCATE'\""),\\n  except_column_list = [\""operation\"", \""sequenceNum\""],\\n  stored_as_scd_type = 1\\n)\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n-- Create and populate the target table.\\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE target;\\n\\nAPPLY CHANGES INTO\\n live.target\\nFROM\\n stream(cdc_data.users)\\nKEYS\\n (userId)\\nAPPLY AS DELETE WHEN\\n operation = \""DELETE\""\\nAPPLY AS TRUNCATE WHEN\\n operation = \""TRUNCATE\""\\nSEQUENCE BY\\n sequenceNum\\nCOLUMNS \\\\* EXCEPT\\n (operation, sequenceNum)\\nSTORED AS\\n SCD TYPE 1;\\n\\n```\\n\\nAfter running the SCD type 1 example, the target table contains the following records:\\n\\n| userId | name | city |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  124 |  Raul |  Oaxaca |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |\\n|  126 |  Lily |  Cancun |\\n\\nAfter running the SCD type 1 example with the additional `TRUNCATE` record, records `124` and `126` are truncated because of the `TRUNCATE` operation at `sequenceNum=3`, and the target table contains the following record:\\n\\n| userId | name | city |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |\\n\\n## Process SCD type 2 updates\\n\\nThe following code example demonstrates processing SCD type 2 updates:\\n\\n```\\nimport dlt\\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, expr\\n\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.view\\ndef users():\\n  return spark.readStream.format(\""delta\"").table(\""cdc_data.users\"")\\n\\ndlt.create_streaming_table(\""target\"")\\n\\ndlt.apply_changes(\\n  target = \""target\"",\\n  source = \""users\"",\\n  keys = [\""userId\""],\\n  sequence_by = col(\""sequenceNum\""),\\n  apply_as_deletes = expr(\""operation = 'DELETE'\""),\\n  except_column_list = [\""operation\"", \""sequenceNum\""],\\n  stored_as_scd_type = \""2\""\\n)\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n-- Create and populate the target table.\\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE target;\\n\\nAPPLY CHANGES INTO\\n live.target\\nFROM\\n stream(cdc_data.users)\\nKEYS\\n (userId)\\nAPPLY AS DELETE WHEN\\n operation = \""DELETE\""\\nSEQUENCE BY\\n sequenceNum\\nCOLUMNS \\\\* EXCEPT\\n (operation, sequenceNum)\\nSTORED AS\\n SCD TYPE 2;\\n\\n```\\n\\nAfter running the SCD type 2 example, the target table contains the following records:\\n\\n| userId | name | city | __START_AT | __END_AT |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  123 |  Isabel |  Monterrey |  1 |  5 |\\n|  123 |  Isabel |  Chihuahua |  5 |  6 |\\n|  124 |  Raul |  Oaxaca |  1 |  null |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Tijuana |  2 |  5 |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Mexicali |  5 |  6 |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |  6 |  null |\\n|  126 |  Lily |  Cancun |  2 |  null |\\n\\n## Track history for only specified columns with SCD type 2\\n\\nSCD type 2 supports specifying a subset of output columns to generate history on those columns only; changes to other columns are updated in place rather than generating new history records.\\n\\nTo use track history in Delta Live Tables SCD type 2, you must explicitly enable the feature in your pipeline by adding the following configuration to your Delta Live Tables pipeline settings:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n \""configuration\"": {\\n \""pipelines.enableTrackHistory\"": \""true\""\\n }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nIf `pipelines.enableTrackHistory` is not set or set to `false`, SCD type 2 queries use the default behavior of generating a history record for every input row.\\n\\nThe following example demonstrates using track history with SCD type 2:\\n\\n```\\nimport dlt\\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, expr\\n\\REDACTED_LOCAL_PART@dlt.view\\ndef users():\\n  return spark.readStream.format(\""delta\"").table(\""cdc_data.users\"")\\n\\ndlt.create_streaming_table(\""target\"")\\n\\ndlt.apply_changes(\\n  target = \""target\"",\\n  source = \""users\"",\\n  keys = [\""userId\""],\\n  sequence_by = col(\""sequenceNum\""),\\n  apply_as_deletes = expr(\""operation = 'DELETE'\""),\\n  except_column_list = [\""operation\"", \""sequenceNum\""],\\n  stored_as_scd_type = \""2\"",\\n  track_history_except_column_list = [\""city\""]\\n)\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n-- Create and populate the target table.\\nCREATE OR REFRESH STREAMING TABLE target;\\n\\nAPPLY CHANGES INTO\\n live.target\\nFROM\\n stream(cdc_data.users)\\nKEYS\\n (userId)\\nAPPLY AS DELETE WHEN\\n operation = \""DELETE\""\\nSEQUENCE BY\\n sequenceNum\\nCOLUMNS \\\\* EXCEPT\\n (operation, sequenceNum)\\nSTORED AS\\n SCD TYPE 2\\nTRACK HISTORY ON \\\\* EXCEPT\\n (city)\\n\\n```\\n\\nAfter running the SCD type 2 with track history example with the additional `TRUNCATE` record, the target table contains the following records:\\n\\n| userId | name | city | __START_AT | __END_AT |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  123 |  Isabel |  Chihuahua |  1 |  6 |\\n|  124 |  Raul |  Oaxaca |  1 |  null |\\n|  125 |  Mercedes |  Guadalajara |  2 |  null |\\n|  126 |  Lily |  Cancun |  2 |  null |\\n\\n## Generate test data\\n\\nThe code below is provided to generate an example dataset for use in the example queries present in this tutorial. Assuming that you have the proper credentials to create a new schema and create a new table, you can execute these statements with either a notebook or Databricks SQL. The following code is **not** intended to be run as part of a Delta Live Tables pipeline:\\n\\n```\\nCREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS cdc_data;\\n\\nCREATE TABLE\\n cdc_data.users\\nAS SELECT\\n col1 AS userId,\\n col2 AS name,\\n col3 AS city,\\n col4 AS operation,\\n col5 AS sequenceNum\\nFROM (\\n VALUES\\n -- Initial load.\\n (124, \""Raul\"", \""Oaxaca\"", \""INSERT\"", 1),\\n (123, \""Isabel\"", \""Monterrey\"", \""INSERT\"", 1),\\n -- New users.\\n (125, \""Mercedes\"", \""Tijuana\"", \""INSERT\"", 2),\\n (126, \""Lily\"", \""Cancun\"", \""INSERT\"", 2),\\n -- Isabel is removed from the system and Mercedes moved to Guadalajara.\\n (123, null, null, \""DELETE\"", 6),\\n (125, \""Mercedes\"", \""Guadalajara\"", \""UPDATE\"", 6),\\n -- This batch of updates arrived out of order.

How do I use databricks secrets?,"To use Databricks secrets, you can store your credentials in a secret scope and reference them in your notebooks and jobs. Here are the steps to set up secrets:

1. Create a secret scope. Secret scope names are case insensitive.
2. Add secrets to the scope. Secret names are case insensitive.
3. If you have the Premium plan, assign access control to the secret scope.

You can use the Secrets utility (dbutils.secrets) to reference secrets in notebooks and jobs. For more information, you can refer to the following resources:

criar uma tabela a partir de arquivos JSON,"Para criar uma tabela a partir de arquivos JSON, é necessário utilizar o SerDe JAR. O primeiro passo é baixar o arquivo json-serde-1.3.8-jar-with-dependencies.jar no [link](http://www.congiu.net/hive-json-serde/1.3.8/hdp23/) fornecido na documentação. Em seguida, é preciso instalar o JAR no cluster. Para isso, selecione o cluster na workspace, clique na aba ""Libraries"", depois em ""Install new"", selecione ""Upload"" em ""Library Source"" e ""JAR"" em ""Library Type"". Arraste o arquivo json-serde-1.3.8-jar-with-dependencies.jar para a área indicada e clique em ""Install"". 

Depois de instalar o JAR, é preciso configurar as propriedades do SerDe na declaração de criação da tabela. O código abaixo é um exemplo de como criar uma tabela a partir de arquivos JSON:

```

Here's an example:\n\n```\n# Read JSON files into a DataFrame\ndf = spark.read.json(\""/path/to/json/files\"")\n\n# Write DataFrame to a table in Databricks\ndf.write.format(\""delta\"").saveAsTable(\""my_table\"")\n```\n\nIn this example, replace `/path/to/json/files` with the path to your JSON files, and `my_table` with the name you want to give your table. Note that we're using the Delta format to write the table, but you can use other formats like Parquet or ORC if you prefer.""

Here's an example:\n\n```\n# Read JSON files into a DataFrame\ndf = spark.read.json(\""/path/to/json/files\"")\n\n# Write DataFrame to a table in Databricks\ndf.write.format(\""delta\"").saveAsTable(\""my_table\"")\n```\n\nIn this example, replace `/path/to/json/files` with the path to your JSON files, and `my_table` with the name you want to give your table. Note that we're using the Delta format to write the table, but you can use other formats like Parquet or ORC if you prefer.""

How to reset web terminal?,"I'm sorry, but the documentation I fetched does not provide information on how to reset the web terminal. However, you can try closing the web terminal panel and reopening it to see if that resolves the issue. If that doesn't work, you can try refreshing the page or logging out and logging back in to your Databricks workspace. If the issue persists, you may need to contact Databricks support for further assistance.",https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/clusters/web-terminal,"[""To reset the web terminal in Databricks, you can click on the 'Reset' button in the terminal window. This will clear the terminal and reset it to its default state. If you want to completely restart the terminal, you can click on the 'Restart' button next to the 'Reset' button. This will close the terminal and open a new one. Note that any unsaved work in the terminal will be lost when you reset or restart it.""]","['# Web terminal\n\nAzure Databricks web terminal provides a convenient and highly interactive way for you to run shell commands and use editors, such as Vim or Emacs, on the Spark driver node. The web terminal can be used by many users on one cluster. Example uses of the web terminal include monitoring resource usage and installing Linux packages.\n\nWeb terminal is disabled by default for all workspace users.\n\nEnabling [Docker Container Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/clusters/custom-containers.html) disables web terminal.\n\nWarning\n\nAzure Databricks proxies the web terminal service from port 7681 on the cluster’s Spark driver. This web proxy is intended for use only with the web terminal. If the port is occupied when the cluster starts or if there is otherwise a conflict, the web terminal may not work as expected. If other web services are launched on port 7681, cluster users may be exposed to potential security exploits. Neither Databricks nor Microsoft is responsible for any issues that result from the installation of unsupported software on a cluster.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* **[Can Attach To](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/auth-authz/access-control/cluster-acl.html#cluster-level-permissions)** permission on a cluster.\n* Your Azure Databricks workspace must have web terminal [enabled](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/clusters/web-terminal.html).\n\n## Launch the web terminal\n\nYou can launch the web terminal from the cluster detail page or from a notebook.\n\n* To launch web terminal from the cluster detail page, click the **Apps** tab and then click **Web Terminal**. A new tab opens with the web terminal UI and the Bash prompt.\n* To launch web terminal from a notebook, click the attached cluster drop-down, hover over the attached cluster, then click **Web Terminal**. The web terminal opens in a panel at the bottom of the screen.\n\nIn the web terminal panel in the notebook, you can use the buttons at the upper-right of the panel to do the following:\n\n```\n+ Open a new terminal session in a new tab ![open a new terminal session](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/new-terminal-session.png).\n+ Reload a terminal session ![reload terminal session](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/reload-terminal-session.png).\n+ Close the bottom panel ![close bottom panel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/close-bottom-panel.png). To reopen the panel, click ![reopen bottom panel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/reopen-bottom-panel.png) at the bottom of the right sidebar.\n```\n\n## Use web terminal\n\nIn the web terminal, you can run commands as root inside the container of the cluster driver node.\n\nEach user can have up to 100 active web terminal sessions (tabs) open. Idle web terminal sessions may time out and the web terminal web application will reconnect, resulting in a new shell process. If you want to keep your Bash session, Databricks recommends using [tmux](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tmux.1.html).\n\n## Limitations\n\n* Azure Databricks does not support running Spark jobs from the web terminal. In addition, Azure Databricks web terminal is not available in the following cluster types:\n\n  + Job clusters\n  + Clusters launched with the `DISABLE_WEB_TERMINAL=true` environment variable set.\n  + Clusters launched with [access mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/compute.html#access-mode) set to **Shared**.\n  + Clusters launched with the Spark configuration `spark.databricks.pyspark.enableProcessIsolation` set to `true`.\n\n* There is a hard limit of 12 hours since the initial page load, after which any connection, even if active, will be terminated. You can refresh the web terminal to reconnect. Databricks recommends using [tmux](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tmux.1.html) to preserve your shell session.\n\n* Enabling [Docker Container Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/clusters/custom-containers.html) disables web terminal.\n']",['https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/clusters/web-terminal'],"[

To find your version of the Databricks CLI, run `databricks -v`.\n\nFor information beyond this tutorial about Databricks CLI versions 0.200 and above, see the [Databricks CLI reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html).\n\nThe Databricks command-line interface (also known as the Databricks CLI) utility provides an easy-to-use interface to automate the Azure Databricks platform from your terminal, command prompt, or automation scripts.\n\nThis article demonstrates how to quickly get started with the Databricks CLI.\n\nThe following hands-on tutorial assumes:\n\n* You have [curl](https://everything.curl.dev/get) installed.\n* You have an Azure Databricks [personal access token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/auth.html#pat) that maps to your Azure Databricks user account for the target Azure Databricks workspace that you want to run the Databricks CLI against.\n* If you are using Linux or macOS, you are running a Linux-style terminal, such as `bash` or `zsh` or the macOS Terminal app.\n* If you are using Windows, you are running a Linux-style terminal, such as the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install), or Git BASH in [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).\n\nComplete the following steps:\n\n1. From your terminal, run the following command to use `curl` to install the CLI:\n\n```\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks/setup-cli/main/install.sh | sh\n\n```\n\nNote\n\nFor Linux or macOS, if an error message states that `/usr/local/bin` is not writable, then run the command again with `sudo`.\n2. Run the CLI\u2019s `configure` command to configure authentication between the CLI and your workspace:\n\n```\ndatabricks configure\n\n```\n\n3. At the first prompt,  `Databricks Host: https://`, enter your [workspace URL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/workspace/workspace-details.html#workspace-url) and press `Enter`.\n4. At the second prompt, `Personal Access Token`, enter your personal access token value and press `Enter`.\n\n## Next steps\n\nAfter you set up the Databricks CLI:\n\n* To learn how to use the CLI, see [Use the CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#use-the-cli).\n* If the CLI does not run or produces unexpected results, see [Verify your CLI installation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/migrate.html#verify-install).\n* To configure the CLI to work with multiple Azure Databricks workspaces as well as with Azure Databricks accounts, see [Get information about configuration profiles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#using-profiles).\n* To use Azure Databricks authentication types other than personal access token authentication, see [Set up authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#cli-auth).\n* For more advanced CLI installation and update instructions, see [Install the CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#install-the-cli) and [Update the CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli-ref.html#update-the-cli).\n\n### Run the Databricks CLI on a cluster\n\nIf you want to install, configure, and run the Databricks CLI on an Azure Databricks [cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/clusters/configure.html) instead of on your local machine, the fastest way to do this is as follows:\n\n1. In the Azure Databricks workspace user interface, on the sidebar, click **Compute**.\n2. Click the name of the existing cluster that you want to install the Databricks CLI on.\n3. Click **Start**, if the cluster is not already running.\n4. After the cluster is running, on the **Apps** tab, click **Web Terminal**. A Bash-style terminal appears, and `curl` is already installed.\n5. Continue with the procedure at the beginning of this article to install, configure, and run the CLI on the cluster.\n\nNote that whenever you click **Start** to start the cluster, you must then reinstall and reconfigure the CLI on the cluster. This is because a new virtual machine is provisioned each time you click **Start**, and the new virtual machine does not include the CLI by default.\n""

Please try logging out of Azure Active Directory and logging back in.\n\n```\n\nThis error can occur if your team has recently moved to using a multi-factor authentication (MFA) policy for Azure Active Directory. To resolve this problem, you must log out of Azure Active Directory by going to `portal.azure.com` and logging out. When you log back in, you should get the prompt to use MFA to log in.\n\nIf that does not work, try logging out completely from all Azure services before attempting to log in again.\n\n## Timeout errors\n\nExpensive operations such as cloning a large repo or checking out a large branch might result in timeout errors, but the operation might complete in the background. You can also try again later if the workspace was under heavy load at the time.\n\nTo work with a large repo, try [sparse checkout](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/repos/git-operations-with-repos.html#sparse).\n\n## 404 errors\n\nIf you get a 404 error when you try to open a non-notebook file, try waiting a few minutes and then trying again. There is a delay of a few minutes between when the workspace is enabled and when the webapp picks up the configuration flag.\n\n## Resolve notebook name conflicts\n\nDifferent notebooks with similar or the same filename can cause an error when you create a repo or pull request: `Cannot perform Git operation due to conflicting names`…. `A folder cannot contain a notebook with the same name as a notebook, file, or folder (excluding file extensions).`\n\nA naming conflict can occur even with different file extensions. For example, these two files conflict:\n\n* `notebook.ipynb`\n* `notebook.py`\n\n![Diagram: Name conflict for notebook, file, or folder.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/asset-name-conflict.png)\n\n### To fix the name conflict\n\n* Rename the notebook, file, or folder contributing to the error state.\n\n  + If this error occurs when you clone the repo, you need to rename notebooks, files, or folders in the remote Git repo.\n\n## `Resource not found` errors with non-notebook files\n\nIf you get `Resource not found` errors after pulling non-notebook files into Databricks Repos, you might not be using Databricks Runtime 8.4 or above. A cluster running Databricks Runtime 8.4 or above is required to work with non-notebook files in a repo.\n\n## Errors suggest recloning\n\n```\nThere was a problem with deleting folders. The repo could be in an inconsistent state and re-cloning is recommended.\n\n```\n\nThis error indicates that a problem occurred while deleting folders from the repo. This could leave the repo in an inconsistent state, where folders that should have been deleted still exist. If this error occurs, Databricks recommends deleting and re-cloning the repo to reset its state.\n\n```\nUnable to set repo to most recent state. This may be due to force pushes overriding commit history on the remote repo. Repo may be out of sync and re-cloning is recommended.\n\n```\n\nThis error indicates that the local and remote Git state have diverged. This can happen when a force push on the remote overrides recent commits that still exist on the local repo. Databricks does not support a hard reset within Repos and recommends deleting and re-cloning the repo if this error occurs.\n\n## Files do not appear after clone or pull\n\nFiles do not appear after cloning a remote repos or pulling files into an existing one. If you know your workspace admin enabled Databricks Repos and support for arbitrary files, try the following:\n\n* Confirm your cluster is running Databricks Runtime 8.4 or above.\n* Refresh your browser and restart your cluster to pick up the new configuration.\n\n## `No experiment...found` or MLflow UI errors\n\nYou might see an Azure Databricks error message `No experiment for node found` or an error in MLflow when you work on an\nMLflow notebook experiment last logged to before the [3.72 platform release](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/release-notes/product/2022/may.html#databricks-repos-fix-to-issue-with-mlflow-experiment-data-loss).\nTo resolve the error, log a new run in the notebook associated with that experiment.\n\nNote\n\nThis applies only to notebook experiments. Creation of new experiments in Repos is [unsupported](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/repos/limits.html#can-i-create-an-mlflow-experiment-in-a-repo).\n']",['https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/repos/errors-troubleshooting'],"[

This may be due to force pushes overriding commit history on the remote repo. Repo may be out of sync and re-cloning is recommended.\n\n```\n\nThis error indicates that the local and remote Git state have diverged. This can happen when a force push on the remote overrides recent commits that still exist on the local repo. Databricks does not support a hard reset within Repos and recommends deleting and re-cloning the repo if this error occurs.\n\n## Files do not appear after clone or pull\n\nFiles do not appear after cloning a remote repos or pulling files into an existing one. If you know your workspace admin enabled Databricks Repos and support for arbitrary files, try the following:\n\n* Confirm your cluster is running Databricks Runtime 8.4 or above.\n* Refresh your browser and restart your cluster to pick up the new configuration.\n\n## `No experiment...found` or MLflow UI errors\n\nYou might see an Azure Databricks error message `No experiment for node found` or an error in MLflow when you work on an\nMLflow notebook experiment last logged to before the [3.72 platform release](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/release-notes/product/2022/may.html#databricks-repos-fix-to-issue-with-mlflow-experiment-data-loss).\nTo resolve the error, log a new run in the notebook associated with that experiment.\n\nNote\n\nThis applies only to notebook experiments.

Clusters that use Databricks Runtime 13.0 and above have access to these metrics by default.\n\nPreviously, cluster metrics were gathered using Ganglia, which provided an external live feed of a limited amount of cluster metrics. Ganglia could only record historical data in 15-minute blocks, archived using static downloadable snapshots.\n\nNow, all live and historical cluster metrics are embedded in the Azure Databricks UI. These metrics can an be filtered by any range of date, hour, and minute within the last 30 days.\n\n## Access cluster metrics UI\n\nTo view the cluster metrics UI:\n\n1. Click **Compute** in the sidebar.\n2. Click on the compute resource you want to view metrics for.\n3. Click the **Metrics** tab.\n\n![Cluster metrics for the last 24 hours](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/cluster-metrics.png)\n\nHardware metrics are shown by default. To view Spark metrics, click the dropdown labeled **Hardware** and select **Spark**. You can also select **GPU** if the instance is GPU-enabled.\n\n## Filter metrics by time period\n\nYou can view historical metrics by selecting a time range using the date picker filter. Metrics are collected every minute, so you can filter by any range of day, hour, or minute from the last 30 days. Click the calendar icon to select from predefined data ranges, or click inside the text box to define custom values.\n\nNote\n\nThe time intervals displayed in the charts adjust based on the length of time you are viewing. Most metrics are averages based on the time interval you are currently viewing.\n\nYou can also get the latest metrics by clicking the **Refresh** button.\n\n## View metrics at the node level\n\nYou can view metrics for individual nodes by clicking the **Cluster** dropdown and selecting the node you want to view metrics for.\n\nNote\n\nGPU metrics are only available at the individual-node level. Spark metrics are not available for individual nodes.\n\n## CPU metric charts\n\nThe following CPU metric charts are available to view in the cluster metrics UI:\n\n* CPU utilization: The percentage of time the CPU spent in each mode, based on total CPU seconds cost. The metric is averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart.\n* Memory utilization: The total memory usage by each mode, measured in bytes and averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart.\n* Memory swap utilization: The total memory swap usage by each mode, measured in bytes and averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart.\n* Free filesystem space: The total filesystem usage by each mount point, measured in bytes and averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart.\n* Received through network: The number of bytes received through the network by each device, averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart.\n* Transmitted through network: The number of bytes transmitted through network by each device, averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart.\n* Number of active nodes: This shows the number of active nodes at every timestamp for the given cluster.\n\n## Spark metrics charts\n\nThe following Spark metric charts are available to view in the cluster metrics UI:\n\n* Active tasks: The total number of tasks executing at any given time, averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart.\n* Total failed tasks: The total number of tasks that have failed in executors, averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart.\n* Total completed tasks: The total number of tasks that have completed in executors, averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart.\n* Total number of tasks: The total number of all tasks (running, failed and completed) in executors, averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart.\n* Total shuffle read: The total size of shuffle read data, measured in bytes and averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart. `Shuffle read` means the sum of serialized read data on all executors at the beginning of a stage.\n* Total shuffle write: The total size of shuffle write data, measured in bytes and averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart. `Shuffle Write` is the sum of all written serialized data on all executors before transmitting (normally at the end of a stage).\n* Total task duration: The total elapsed time the JVM spent executing tasks on executors, measured in seconds and averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart.\n\n## GPU metric charts\n\nThe following GPU metric charts are available to view in the cluster metrics UI:\n\n* Per-GPU decoder utilization: The percentage of GPU decoder utilization, averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart.\n* Per-GPU encoder utilization: The percentage of GPU encoder utilization, averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart.\n* Per-GPU frame buffer memory utilization bytes: The frame buffer memory utilization, measured in bytes and averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart.\n* Per-GPU memory utilization: The percentage of GPU memory utilization, averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart.\n* Per-GPU utilization: The percentage of GPU utilization, averaged out based on whichever time interval is displayed in the chart.\n']",['https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/compute/cluster-metrics'],"[

Clusters that use Databricks Runtime 13.0 and above have access to these metrics by default.\n\nPreviously, cluster metrics were gathered using Ganglia, which provided an external live feed of a limited amount of cluster metrics. Ganglia could only record historical data in 15-minute blocks, archived using static downloadable snapshots.\n\nNow, all live and historical cluster metrics are embedded in the Azure Databricks UI. These metrics can an be filtered by any range of date, hour, and minute within the last 30 days.\n\n## Access cluster metrics UI\n\nTo view the cluster metrics UI:\n\n1. Click **Compute** in the sidebar.\n2. Click on the compute resource you want to view metrics for.\n3. Click the **Metrics** tab.\n\n![Cluster metrics for the last 24 hours](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/cluster-metrics.png)\n\nHardware metrics are shown by default. To view Spark metrics, click the dropdown labeled **Hardware** and select **Spark**. You can also select **GPU** if the instance is GPU-enabled.\n\n## Filter metrics by time period\n\nYou can view historical metrics by selecting a time range using the date picker filter. Metrics are collected every minute, so you can filter by any range of day, hour, or minute from the last 30 days. Click the calendar icon to select from predefined data ranges, or click inside the text box to define custom values.\n\nNote\n\nThe time intervals displayed in the charts adjust based on the length of time you are viewing. Most metrics are averages based on the time interval you are currently viewing.\n\nYou can also get the latest metrics by clicking the **Refresh** button.\n\n## View metrics at the node level\n\nYou can view metrics for individual nodes by clicking the **Cluster** dropdown and selecting the node you want to view metrics for.\n\nNote\n\nGPU metrics are only available at the individual-node level. Spark metrics are not available for individual nodes.\n\n## CPU metric charts\n\nThe following CPU metric charts are available to view in the cluster metrics UI:\n\n* CPU utilization: The percentage of time the CPU spent in each mode, based on total CPU seconds cost.

First, navigate to the user settings page in the Databricks workspace. Then, click on the 'Access Tokens' tab and click 'Generate New Token'. From there, you can name your token and select the appropriate cluster permissions. Finally, click 'Generate' to create your personal access token.""]","['# Provision a service principal for Azure Databricks automation - Azure Databricks UI\n\nA [service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html) is an identity for automated tools and systems like scripts, apps, and CI/CD platforms. Databricks recommends using a service principal and its OAuth token or personal access token instead of your Azure Databricks user account and personal access token. Benefits include:\n\n* Granting and restricting access to resources independently of a user.\n* Enabling users to better protect their own access tokens.\n* Disabling or deleting a service principal without affecting other users.\n* Removing a user when they leave the organization without impacting any service principal.\n\nTo provision an Azure AD service principal, Databricks recommends that you create an Azure service principal in your Azure account and then add the Azure service principal to your Azure Databricks account. Then you add that Azure service principal to your target Azure Databricks workspace to act as an Azure AD service principal and give the Azure AD service principal workspace permissions. Finally, you use Databricks client unified authentication to generate Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tokens, which are used to represent the Azure AD service principal programmatically in calls from Azure Databricks tools and SDKs. Use this quickstart to complete these steps.\n\n## Step 1: Create an Azure service principal in your Azure account\n\n1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).\n\nNote\n\nThe portal to use is different depending on whether your Azure AD application runs in the Azure public cloud or in a national or sovereign cloud. For more information, see [National clouds](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-national-cloud).\n2. If you have access to multiple tenants, subscriptions, or directories, click the **Directories + subscriptions** (directory with filter) icon in the top menu to switch to the directory in which you want to provision the service principal.\n3. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.\n4. Click **+ Add** and select **App registration**.\n5. For **Name**, enter a name for the application.\n6. In the **Supported account types** section, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)**.\n7. Click **Register**.\n8. Within **Manage**, click **Certificates & secrets**.\n9. On the **Client secrets** tab, click **New client secret**.\n\n![New client secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/copy-secret.png)\n10. In the **Add a client secret** pane, for **Description**, enter a description for the client secret.\n11. For **Expires**, select an expiry time period for the client secret, and then click **Add**.\n12. Copy and store the client secret’s **Value** in a secure place, as this client secret is the password for your application.\n13. On the application page’s **Overview** page, in the **Essentials** section, copy the following values:\n\n```\n* **Application (client) ID**\n* **Directory (tenant) ID**\n```\n\n![Azure registered app overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/registeredapp.png)\n\n## Step 2: Add the Azure service principal to your Azure Databricks account\n\nThis steps works only if your target Azure Databricks workspace is enabled for [identity federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/index.html#enable-identity-federation). If your workspace is not enabled for identity federation, skip ahead to Step 3.\n\n1. In your Azure Databricks workspace, click your username in the top bar and click **Manage account**.\n\nAlternatively, go directly to your Azure Databricks account console, at <https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net>.\n2. Sign in to your Azure Databricks account, if prompted.\n3. On the sidebar, click **User management**.\n4. Click the **Service principals** tab.\n5. Click **Add service principal**.\n6. Enter a **Name** for the Azure service principal.\n7. For **UUID**, enter the **Application (client) ID** value from Step 1.\n8. Click **Add**. Your Azure service principal is added as a service principal in your Azure Databricks account.\n9. (Optional) Assign account-level permissions to the Azure AD service principal:\n\n```\n1. On the **Service principals** tab, click the name of your Azure AD service principal.\n2. On the **Roles** tab, toggle to enable or disable each target role that you want this Azure AD service principal to have.\n3. On the **Permissions** tab, grant access to any Azure Databricks users, service principals, and account group roles that you want to manage and use this Azure AD service principal. See [Manage roles on a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html#manage-sp-permissions).\n```\n\n## Step 3: Add the Azure service principal to your Azure Databricks workspace\n\nIf your workspace is enabled for [identity federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/index.html#enable-identity-federation):\n\n1. In your Azure Databricks workspace, click your username in the top bar and click **Admin Settings**.\n2. Click **Service principals**.\n3. Click **Add service principal**.\n4. Select your Azure service principal from Step 2 and click **Add**. Your Azure service principal is added as a service principal in your Azure Databricks workspace.\n\nSkip ahead to Step 4.\n\nIf your workspace is not enabled for identity federation:\n\n1. In your Azure Databricks workspace, click your username in the top bar and click **Admin Settings**.\n2. Click **Service principals**.\n3. Click **Add service principal**.\n4. In the **Service Principal** list, select **Add new service principal**.\n5. For **ApplicationId**, enter the **Application (client) ID** for your Azure service principal from Step 1.\n6. Enter some **Display Name** for the new Azure AD service principal and click **Add**. Your Azure service principal is added as a service principal in your Azure Databricks workspace.\n\n## Step 4: Assign workspace-level permissions to the Azure AD service principal\n\n1. If the admin console for your workspace is not already opened, click your username in the top bar and click **Admin Settings**.\n2. On the **Service principals** tab, click the name of your Azure AD service principal to open its settings page.\n3. On the **Configurations** tab, check the box next to each entitlement that you want your Azure AD service principal to have for this workspace, and then click **Update**.\n4. On the **Permissions** tab, grant access to any Azure Databricks users, service principals, and groups that you want to manage and use this Azure AD service principal. See [Manage roles on a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html#manage-sp-permissions).\n\n## Step 5: Generate Azure AD tokens for the Azure AD service principal\n\nTo generate Azure AD tokens, Databricks recommends that you use Azure service principal authentication. This authentication type is supported across Azure Databricks tools and SDKs that implement the Databricks client unified authentication standard. These tools and SDKs generate and manage Azure AD tokens for you automatically. For details, see [Azure service principal authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/auth.html#azure-sp-auth).\n\n## Next steps\n\nThis tutorial showed you how to set up an Azure AD service principal by using the Azure portal and the Azure Databricks user interface. To use the Databricks Terraform provider instead, see [Provision a service principal for Azure Databricks automation - Terraform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/service-principals-tools-apis.html).\n']",['https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/service-principals'],"[

Databricks recommends using a service principal and its OAuth token or personal access token instead of your Azure Databricks user account and personal access token. Benefits include:\n\n* Granting and restricting access to resources independently of a user.\n* Enabling users to better protect their own access tokens.\n* Disabling or deleting a service principal without affecting other users.\n* Removing a user when they leave the organization without impacting any service principal.\n\nTo provision an Azure AD service principal, Databricks recommends that you create an Azure service principal in your Azure account and then add the Azure service principal to your Azure Databricks account. Then you add that Azure service principal to your target Azure Databricks workspace to act as an Azure AD service principal and give the Azure AD service principal workspace permissions. Finally, you use Databricks client unified authentication to generate Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tokens, which are used to represent the Azure AD service principal programmatically in calls from Azure Databricks tools and SDKs. Use this quickstart to complete these steps.\n\n## Step 1: Create an Azure service principal in your Azure account\n\n1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).\n\nNote\n\nThe portal to use is different depending on whether your Azure AD application runs in the Azure public cloud or in a national or sovereign cloud. For more information, see [National clouds](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-national-cloud).\n2. If you have access to multiple tenants, subscriptions, or directories, click the **Directories + subscriptions** (directory with filter) icon in the top menu to switch to the directory in which you want to provision the service principal.\n3. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.\n4. Click **+ Add** and select **App registration**.\n5. For **Name**, enter a name for the application.\n6. In the **Supported account types** section, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)**.\n7. Click **Register**.\n8. Within **Manage**, click **Certificates & secrets**.\n9. On the **Client secrets** tab, click **New client secret**.\n\n![New client secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/copy-secret.png)\n10. In the **Add a client secret** pane, for **Description**, enter a description for the client secret.\n11. For **Expires**, select an expiry time period for the client secret, and then click **Add**.\n12. Copy and store the client secret\u2019s **Value** in a secure place, as this client secret is the password for your application.\n13. On the application page\u2019s **Overview** page, in the **Essentials** section, copy the following values:\n\n```\n* **Application (client) ID**\n* **Directory (tenant) ID**\n```\n\n![Azure registered app overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/registeredapp.png)\n\n## Step 2: Add the Azure service principal to your Azure Databricks account\n\nThis steps works only if your target Azure Databricks workspace is enabled for [identity federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/index.html#enable-identity-federation). If your workspace is not enabled for identity federation, skip ahead to Step 3.\n\n1. In your Azure Databricks workspace, click your username in the top bar and click **Manage account**.\n\nAlternatively, go directly to your Azure Databricks account console, at <https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net>.\n2. Sign in to your Azure Databricks account, if prompted.\n3. On the sidebar, click **User management**.\n4. Click the **Service principals** tab.\n5. Click **Add service principal**.\n6. Enter a **Name** for the Azure service principal.\n7. For **UUID**, enter the **Application (client) ID** value from Step 1.\n8. Click **Add**. Your Azure service principal is added as a service principal in your Azure Databricks account.\n9. (Optional) Assign account-level permissions to the Azure AD service principal:\n\n```\n1. On the **Service principals** tab, click the name of your Azure AD service principal.\n2. On the **Roles** tab, toggle to enable or disable each target role that you want this Azure AD service principal to have.\n3. On the **Permissions** tab, grant access to any Azure Databricks users, service principals, and account group roles that you want to manage and use this Azure AD service principal. See [Manage roles on a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html#manage-sp-permissions).\n```\n\n## Step 3: Add the Azure service principal to your Azure Databricks workspace\n\nIf your workspace is enabled for [identity federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/index.html#enable-identity-federation):\n\n1. In your Azure Databricks workspace, click your username in the top bar and click **Admin Settings**.\n2. Click **Service principals**.\n3. Click **Add service principal**.\n4. Select your Azure service principal from Step 2 and click **Add**. Your Azure service principal is added as a service principal in your Azure Databricks workspace.\n\nSkip ahead to Step 4.\n\nIf your workspace is not enabled for identity federation:\n\n1. In your Azure Databricks workspace, click your username in the top bar and click **Admin Settings**.\n2. Click **Service principals**.\n3. Click **Add service principal**.\n4. In the **Service Principal** list, select **Add new service principal**.\n5. For **ApplicationId**, enter the **Application (client) ID** for your Azure service principal from Step 1.\n6. Enter some **Display Name** for the new Azure AD service principal and click **Add**. Your Azure service principal is added as a service principal in your Azure Databricks workspace.\n\n## Step 4: Assign workspace-level permissions to the Azure AD service principal\n\n1. If the admin console for your workspace is not already opened, click your username in the top bar and click **Admin Settings**.\n2. On the **Service principals** tab, click the name of your Azure AD service principal to open its settings page.\n3. On the **Configurations** tab, check the box next to each entitlement that you want your Azure AD service principal to have for this workspace, and then click **Update**.\n4. On the **Permissions** tab, grant access to any Azure Databricks users, service principals, and groups that you want to manage and use this Azure AD service principal. See [Manage roles on a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html#manage-sp-permissions).\n\n## Step 5: Generate Azure AD tokens for the Azure AD service principal\n\nTo generate Azure AD tokens, Databricks recommends that you use Azure service principal authentication. This authentication type is supported across Azure Databricks tools and SDKs that implement the Databricks client unified authentication standard. These tools and SDKs generate and manage Azure AD tokens for you automatically. For details, see [Azure service principal authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/auth.html#azure-sp-auth).\n\n## Next steps\n\nThis tutorial showed you how to set up an Azure AD service principal by using the Azure portal and the Azure Databricks user interface. To use the Databricks Terraform provider instead, see [Provision a service principal for Azure Databricks automation - Terraform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/service-principals-tools-apis.html).\n""

                    ""content"": ""# Provision a service principal for Azure Databricks automation - Azure Databricks UI\n\nA [service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html) is an identity for automated tools and systems like scripts, apps, and CI/CD platforms. Databricks recommends using a service principal and its OAuth token or personal access token instead of your Azure Databricks user account and personal access token. Benefits include:\n\n* Granting and restricting access to resources independently of a user.\n* Enabling users to better protect their own access tokens.\n* Disabling or deleting a service principal without affecting other users.\n* Removing a user when they leave the organization without impacting any service principal.\n\nTo provision an Azure AD service principal, Databricks recommends that you create an Azure service principal in your Azure account and then add the Azure service principal to your Azure Databricks account. Then you add that Azure service principal to your target Azure Databricks workspace to act as an Azure AD service principal and give the Azure AD service principal workspace permissions. Finally, you use Databricks client unified authentication to generate Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tokens, which are used to represent the Azure AD service principal programmatically in calls from Azure Databricks tools and SDKs. Use this quickstart to complete these steps.\n\n## Step 1: Create an Azure service principal in your Azure account\n\n1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).\n\nNote\n\nThe portal to use is different depending on whether your Azure AD application runs in the Azure public cloud or in a national or sovereign cloud. For more information, see [National clouds](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-national-cloud).\n2. If you have access to multiple tenants, subscriptions, or directories, click the **Directories + subscriptions** (directory with filter) icon in the top menu to switch to the directory in which you want to provision the service principal.\n3. Search for and select **Azure Active Directory**.\n4. Click **+ Add** and select **App registration**.\n5. For **Name**, enter a name for the application.\n6. In the **Supported account types** section, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)**.\n7. Click **Register**.\n8. Within **Manage**, click **Certificates & secrets**.\n9. On the **Client secrets** tab, click **New client secret**.\n\n![New client secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/copy-secret.png)\n10. In the **Add a client secret** pane, for **Description**, enter a description for the client secret.\n11. For **Expires**, select an expiry time period for the client secret, and then click **Add**.\n12. Copy and store the client secret\u2019s **Value** in a secure place, as this client secret is the password for your application.\n13. On the application page\u2019s **Overview** page, in the **Essentials** section, copy the following values:\n\n```\n* **Application (client) ID**\n* **Directory (tenant) ID**\n```\n\n![Azure registered app overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/registeredapp.png)\n\n## Step 2: Add the Azure service principal to your Azure Databricks account\n\nThis steps works only if your target Azure Databricks workspace is enabled for [identity federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/index.html#enable-identity-federation). If your workspace is not enabled for identity federation, skip ahead to Step 3.\n\n1. In your Azure Databricks workspace, click your username in the top bar and click **Manage account**.\n\nAlternatively, go directly to your Azure Databricks account console, at <https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net>.\n2. Sign in to your Azure Databricks account, if prompted.\n3. On the sidebar, click **User management**.\n4. Click the **Service principals** tab.\n5. Click **Add service principal**.\n6. Enter a **Name** for the Azure service principal.\n7. For **UUID**, enter the **Application (client) ID** value from Step 1.\n8. Click **Add**. Your Azure service principal is added as a service principal in your Azure Databricks account.\n9. (Optional) Assign account-level permissions to the Azure AD service principal:\n\n```\n1. On the **Service principals** tab, click the name of your Azure AD service principal.\n2. On the **Roles** tab, toggle to enable or disable each target role that you want this Azure AD service principal to have.\n3. On the **Permissions** tab, grant access to any Azure Databricks users, service principals, and account group roles that you want to manage and use this Azure AD service principal. See [Manage roles on a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html#manage-sp-permissions).\n```\n\n## Step 3: Add the Azure service principal to your Azure Databricks workspace\n\nIf your workspace is enabled for [identity federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/index.html#enable-identity-federation):\n\n1. In your Azure Databricks workspace, click your username in the top bar and click **Admin Settings**.\n2. Click **Service principals**.\n3. Click **Add service principal**.\n4. Select your Azure service principal from Step 2 and click **Add**. Your Azure service principal is added as a service principal in your Azure Databricks workspace.\n\nSkip ahead to Step 4.\n\nIf your workspace is not enabled for identity federation:\n\n1. In your Azure Databricks workspace, click your username in the top bar and click **Admin Settings**.\n2. Click **Service principals**.\n3. Click **Add service principal**.\n4. In the **Service Principal** list, select **Add new service principal**.\n5. For **ApplicationId**, enter the **Application (client) ID** for your Azure service principal from Step 1.\n6. Enter some **Display Name** for the new Azure AD service principal and click **Add**. Your Azure service principal is added as a service principal in your Azure Databricks workspace.\n\n## Step 4: Assign workspace-level permissions to the Azure AD service principal\n\n1. If the admin console for your workspace is not already opened, click your username in the top bar and click **Admin Settings**.\n2. On the **Service principals** tab, click the name of your Azure AD service principal to open its settings page.\n3. On the **Configurations** tab, check the box next to each entitlement that you want your Azure AD service principal to have for this workspace, and then click **Update**.\n4. On the **Permissions** tab, grant access to any Azure Databricks users, service principals, and groups that you want to manage and use this Azure AD service principal. See [Manage roles on a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html#manage-sp-permissions).\n\n## Step 5: Generate Azure AD tokens for the Azure AD service principal\n\nTo generate Azure AD tokens, Databricks recommends that you use Azure service principal authentication. This authentication type is supported across Azure Databricks tools and SDKs that implement the Databricks client unified authentication standard. These tools and SDKs generate and manage Azure AD tokens for you automatically. For details, see [Azure service principal authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/auth.html#azure-sp-auth).\n\n## Next steps\n\nThis tutorial showed you how to set up an Azure AD service principal by using the Azure portal and the Azure Databricks user interface. To use the Databricks Terraform provider instead, see [Provision a service principal for Azure Databricks automation - Terraform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/service-principals-tools-apis.html).\n""

In the **Add a client secret** pane, for **Description**, enter a description for the client secret.\n11. For **Expires**, select an expiry time period for the client secret, and then click **Add**.\n12. Copy and store the client secret\u2019s **Value** in a secure place, as this client secret is the password for your application.\n13. On the application page\u2019s **Overview** page, in the **Essentials** section, copy the following values:\n\n```\n* **Application (client) ID**\n* **Directory (tenant) ID**\n```\n\n![Azure registered app overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_images/registeredapp.png)\n\n## Step 2: Add the Azure service principal to your Azure Databricks account\n\nThis steps works only if your target Azure Databricks workspace is enabled for [identity federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/index.html#enable-identity-federation). If your workspace is not enabled for identity federation, skip ahead to Step 3.\n\n1. In your Azure Databricks workspace, click your username in the top bar and click **Manage account**.\n\nAlternatively, go directly to your Azure Databricks account console, at <https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net>.\n2. Sign in to your Azure Databricks account, if prompted.\n3. On the sidebar, click **User management**.\n4. Click the **Service principals** tab.\n5. Click **Add service principal**.\n6. Enter a **Name** for the Azure service principal.\n7. For **UUID**, enter the **Application (client) ID** value from Step 1.\n8. Click **Add**. Your Azure service principal is added as a service principal in your Azure Databricks account.\n9. (Optional) Assign account-level permissions to the Azure AD service principal:\n\n```\n1. On the **Service principals** tab, click the name of your Azure AD service principal.\n2. On the **Roles** tab, toggle to enable or disable each target role that you want this Azure AD service principal to have.\n3. On the **Permissions** tab, grant access to any Azure Databricks users, service principals, and account group roles that you want to manage and use this Azure AD service principal. See [Manage roles on a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html#manage-sp-permissions).\n```\n\n## Step 3: Add the Azure service principal to your Azure Databricks workspace\n\nIf your workspace is enabled for [identity federation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/index.html#enable-identity-federation):\n\n1. In your Azure Databricks workspace, click your username in the top bar and click **Admin Settings**.\n2. Click **Service principals**.\n3. Click **Add service principal**.\n4. Select your Azure service principal from Step 2 and click **Add**. Your Azure service principal is added as a service principal in your Azure Databricks workspace.\n\nSkip ahead to Step 4.\n\nIf your workspace is not enabled for identity federation:\n\n1. In your Azure Databricks workspace, click your username in the top bar and click **Admin Settings**.\n2. Click **Service principals**.\n3. Click **Add service principal**.\n4. In the **Service Principal** list, select **Add new service principal**.\n5. For **ApplicationId**, enter the **Application (client) ID** for your Azure service principal from Step 1.\n6. Enter some **Display Name** for the new Azure AD service principal and click **Add**. Your Azure service principal is added as a service principal in your Azure Databricks workspace.\n\n## Step 4: Assign workspace-level permissions to the Azure AD service principal\n\n1. If the admin console for your workspace is not already opened, click your username in the top bar and click **Admin Settings**.\n2. On the **Service principals** tab, click the name of your Azure AD service principal to open its settings page.\n3. On the **Configurations** tab, check the box next to each entitlement that you want your Azure AD service principal to have for this workspace, and then click **Update**.\n4. On the **Permissions** tab, grant access to any Azure Databricks users, service principals, and groups that you want to manage and use this Azure AD service principal. See [Manage roles on a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html#manage-sp-permissions).\n\n## Step 5: Generate Azure AD tokens for the Azure AD service principal\n\nTo generate Azure AD tokens, Databricks recommends that you use Azure service principal authentication. This authentication type is supported across Azure Databricks tools and SDKs that implement the Databricks client unified authentication standard. These tools and SDKs generate and manage Azure AD tokens for you automatically. For details, see [Azure service principal authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/auth.html#azure-sp-auth).\n\n## Next steps\n\nThis tutorial showed you how to set up an Azure AD service principal by using the Azure portal and the Azure Databricks user interface. To use the Databricks Terraform provider instead, see [Provision a service principal for Azure Databricks automation - Terraform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/service-principals-tools-apis.html).\n\n````\n\nProvided context:\n - \n The user is viewing a page titled \""Compute - Databricks\"" in the Databricks product.
