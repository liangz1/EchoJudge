            The Delta Sharing server supports several unique features that are not
            typically supported in other protocols. These include:


            1. Unified Data Access: Delta Sharing enables unified access to data across
            different data sources and formats, eliminating the need for separate
            connectors or protocols for each source. It allows users to access a wide
            range of data formats and sources including data lakes, data warehouses,
            and other systems.


            2. Secure Data Sharing: Delta Sharing provides built-in security mechanisms
            that ensure secure data sharing. It supports authentication and authorization
            through integration with existing identity providers, enabling fine-grained
            access control to data.


            3. Query Pushdown: Delta Sharing allows query pushdown, which means that
            the server can push down the execution of certain operations to the data
            source itself. This optimizes performance by reducing data movement and
            processing on the client side.


            4. Schema Evolution: Delta Sharing supports schema evolution, allowing
            the schema of shared data to evolve over time without breaking existing
            queries or applications. It provides compatibility checks and handles
            schema evolution seamlessly.


            5. Incremental Data Sharing: Delta Sharing supports incremental data sharing,
            where only the changed or delta data is shared instead of the entire dataset.
            This reduces data transfer and storage costs, especially for large datasets
            that are frequently updated.


            6. Data Versioning: Delta Sharing maintains version history of shared
            data, allowing users to access and query past versions of the data. This
            is particularly useful for auditing, compliance, and data lineage purposes.


            7. Data Consistency Guarantees: Delta Sharing ensures strong consistency
            guarantees for shared data, maintaining the ACID properties (Atomicity,
            Consistency, Isolation, Durability) during data sharing operations. This
            ensures data integrity and reliability.


            8. Data Catalog Integration: Delta Sharing integrates with data catalogs,
            such as the Delta Lake catalog, enabling easy discovery and exploration
            of shared data. It provides metadata about the shared datasets, facilitating
            data governance and catalog management.


            These unique features make Delta Sharing a powerful and versatile protocol
            for enabling secure and efficient data sharing across different systems
            and formats.

            The Delta Sharing server, built into Databricks, supports some features
            that are not available in other protocols. These features include:


            1. Notebook sharing: The Delta Sharing server allows sharing of notebooks
            between providers and recipients, enabling collaborative data analysis
            and exploration.


            2. Unity Catalog volume sharing: With the Delta Sharing server, you can
            share Unity Catalog volumes, which are collections of datasets, with other
            users or teams. This simplifies data sharing and collaboration within
            an organization.


            3. Unity Catalog data governance: The integration with Unity Catalog enables
            enhanced data governance capabilities, such as access controls, data lineage
            tracking, and metadata management, ensuring data integrity and compliance.


            4. Auditing: The Delta Sharing server provides auditing functionality,
            allowing you to track and monitor data sharing activities, including who
            accessed the data and when.


            5. Usage tracking: Both providers and recipients can benefit from usage
            tracking capabilities offered by the Delta Sharing server. It helps providers
            understand how their shared data is being utilized, while recipients can

            In Delta Sharing, a share is a read-only collection of tables and table
            partitions that a provider wants to share with one or more recipients.
            If the recipient uses a Unity Catalog-enabled Databricks workspace, notebook
            files, views, and Unity Catalog volumes can also be included in a share.
            Tables, views, volumes, and notebook files can be added or removed from
            a share at any time, and data recipient access can be assigned or revoked
            at any time. In a Unity Catalog-enabled Databricks workspace, a share
            is a securable object registered in Unity Catalog. If a share is removed
            from the Unity Catalog metastore, all recipients of that share lose the

            In Delta Sharing, a share refers to a unit of data that is made available
            for consumption by external entities or applications. It represents a
            specific set of data, such as a table, a database, or a collection of
            files, that can be accessed by authorized users or systems. Shares in
            Delta Sharing allow data producers to securely and efficiently share their
            data with consumers, enabling seamless data exchange and collaboration
            across different organizations or platforms.

            A recipient in Unity Catalog is an entity that receives shares from a
            provider. In Unity Catalog, a share is a securable object that represents
            an organization and associates it with a credential or secure sharing
            identifier that allows that organization to access one or more shares.
            Recipients can have access to multiple shares, and if a provider deletes
            a recipient from their Unity Catalog metastore, that recipient loses access
            to all shares it could previously access. This information is important
            for understanding the sharing and access control mechanisms in Unity Catalog.

            Open Delta Sharing allows data providers to share data with users outside
            of their Databricks workspace, regardless of whether they use Databricks.
            Data providers generate a token and securely share it with the recipient,
            who uses the token to authenticate and gain read access to the tables
            included in the shares. Recipients can access the shared data using various
            computing tools and platforms, including Databricks, Apache Spark, Pandas,
            and Power BI. Open Delta Sharing provides a secure way to share data with
            external users and enables cross-platform data access.

            Open Delta Sharing is a technology developed by Facebook that enables
            the secure and efficient sharing of large-scale machine learning (ML)
            models and data between organizations. It is designed to address the challenges
            of distributing and collaborating on ML models while ensuring privacy
            and data protection.


            Open Delta Sharing allows organizations to securely share their ML models
            without the need to expose or transfer the underlying data. Instead, the
            models are transformed into a compact representation called a "delta"
            that captures the knowledge of the model without revealing sensitive data.
            This delta can then be shared with other organizations, enabling collaboration
            and knowledge transfer while maintaining privacy.


            By using Open Delta Sharing, organizations can benefit from improved model
            accuracy, reduced development time, and increased collaboration opportunities.
            It also provides a privacy-preserving solution by ensuring that sensitive
            data remains protected throughout the sharing process.

            Databricks-to-Databricks Delta Sharing is a feature provided by Databricks
            that allows users to easily share and collaborate on Delta Lake tables
            across different Databricks workspaces or accounts. It enables users to
            securely share and access data without the need for data movement or replication.


            With Databricks-to-Databricks Delta Sharing, data producers can publish
            Delta Lake tables to a shared location called a "Delta Sharing Provider."
            These tables can then be accessed by consumers who have access to the
            provider. Consumers can read, query, and even subscribe to changes in
            these shared tables, enabling real-time collaboration and data sharing.


            This feature provides a unified data sharing experience, allowing different
            teams or organizations to work with shared data seamlessly. It offers
            a secure and scalable way to share data without the overhead of data movement,
            reducing duplication and data inconsistencies.


            Databricks-to-Databricks Delta Sharing is built on Delta Lake, which adds
            reliability and transactional capabilities to data lakes. It ensures data
            integrity and consistency while enabling efficient data sharing and collaboration.

            In a Delta Sharing share, various types of assets can be included. Some
            of the commonly shared assets include:


            1. Tables: Tables are the primary assets that can be shared in Delta Sharing.
            These can be structured data tables containing rows and columns of information.


            2. Databases: Entire databases or specific database tables can be shared
            through Delta Sharing. This allows sharing of multiple related tables
            together.


            3. Files: Delta Sharing also supports sharing of files. These can be any
            type of files such as text files, CSV files, Parquet files, or other file
            formats.


            4. Views: Views created on top of tables or databases can be shared as
            well. Views provide a way to present a customized and filtered version
            of the data to the recipient.


            5. Queries: Instead of sharing the entire dataset, specific queries can
            be shared. Recipients can execute these queries to retrieve the desired
            data from the shared dataset.


            It is important to note that Delta Sharing focuses on sharing data assets
            rather than sharing computational resources or executing complex operations
            on the shared data.

            Databricks recommends using Auto Loader for incremental data ingestion.
            Auto Loader automatically detects and processes new files as they arrive
            in cloud object storage. Users or service principals with READ FILES permissions
            on an external location can use Auto Loader to ingest data. Normally,
            data will arrive in an external location due to writes from other systems.

            can use Auto Loader to ingest data. Normally, data will arrive in an external

            location with READ FILES, WRITE FILES, and CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE permissions.
            External locations can be defined as an entire storage container, but
            often point to a directory nested in a container. The correct format for
            an external location path is "s3://bucket-name/path/to/external_location".

            The recommended method for incremental data ingestion in Databricks is
            to use Delta Lake. Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that provides
            ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and data versioning capabilities
            on top of Apache Spark.


            Delta Lake allows you to efficiently handle change data capture (CDC)
            scenarios by providing a transactional log that tracks changes made to
            the data. This log can be used to perform incremental data ingestion by
            reading only the new or updated records since the last ingestion.


            To perform incremental data ingestion using Delta Lake, you can follow
            these steps:


            1. Initialize a Delta Lake table using the existing data.

            2. Write new or updated data to the Delta Lake table using the `merge`
            operation. The `merge` operation allows you to update existing records
            or insert new records based on a specified condition.

            3. Use the transaction log to identify the changes made to the table since
            the last ingestion. This can be done by reading the transaction log using
            the Delta Lake API.

            4. Process the incremental changes and update downstream systems or perform
            any required transformations.


            By using Delta Lake for incremental data ingestion, you can ensure data
            consistency, reliability, and scalability in your data pipelines. It also
            provides the ability to easily roll back to previous versions of the data
            in case of any issues or errors.

            When choosing between Auto Loader and COPY INTO for data ingestion in
            Databricks, there are a few considerations to keep in mind. If you're
            going to ingest files in the order of thousands, you can use COPY INTO.
            However, if you are expecting files in the order of millions or more over
            time, it's recommended to use Auto Loader. Auto Loader requires fewer
            total operations to discover files compared to COPY INTO and can split
            the processing into multiple batches, making it less expensive and more
            efficient at scale. These considerations help in determining the most
            suitable method for data ingestion based on the volume and nature of the
            data being processed.

            When choosing between Auto Loader and COPY INTO for data ingestion in
            Databricks, there are several considerations to keep in mind:


            1. Data source: Auto Loader is specifically designed to ingest streaming
            data from cloud storage sources like Azure Blob Storage or AWS S3. On
            the other hand, COPY INTO is more suitable for batch data ingestion from
            various sources including cloud storage, SFTP, or on-premises locations.


            2. Data volume and velocity: Auto Loader is well-suited for handling high
            volume and high-velocity streaming data, while COPY INTO is more suitable
            for batch data ingestion with a relatively lower volume and velocity.


            3. Data format: Auto Loader supports only certain file formats like Apache
            Parquet, Apache Avro, JSON, CSV, and Delta Lake. COPY INTO, on the other
            hand, supports a wider range of file formats including Parquet, Avro,
            CSV, JSON, ORC, and more.


            4. Data partitioning: Auto Loader automatically partitions the ingested
            data based on the provided partition configuration, making it easier to
            query and analyze. COPY INTO can also partition data, but it requires
            manual configuration.


            5. Cost: Auto Loader has a built-in feature called automatic schema evolution,
            which allows for incremental schema updates without rewriting the entire
            dataset. This can save storage costs. COPY INTO does not have this feature
            and requires rewriting the entire dataset for schema updates.


            6. Ease of use: Auto Loader simplifies the data ingestion process by automatically
            discovering new files in the specified location and ingesting them. COPY
            INTO requires explicit configuration and execution for each ingestion.


            7. Data reliability: Auto Loader provides fault-tolerance and guarantees
            exactly-once semantics for data ingestion, ensuring data integrity. COPY
            INTO does not provide these guarantees.


            Ultimately, the choice between Auto Loader and COPY INTO depends on the
            specific requirements of the data ingestion process, such as the data
            source, volume, velocity, format, partitioning needs, cost considerations,
            and ease of use.

            When choosing between Auto Loader and COPY INTO for data ingestion in
            Databricks, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:


            1. File Volume: If you expect to ingest a large number of files in the
            order of thousands, you can use COPY INTO. On the other hand, if you anticipate
            millions of files or more over time, it is recommended to use Auto Loader.


            2. Scalability: Auto Loader is designed to handle large-scale data ingestion
            efficiently. It requires fewer total operations to discover files compared
            to COPY INTO and can split the processing into multiple batches. This
            makes Auto Loader more cost-effective and efficient at scale.


            3. Data Schema: If your data schema remains consistent across all files,
            both COPY INTO and Auto Loader can be used. However, if you have varying
            schemas within your files, Auto Loader supports schema evolution, allowing
            you to handle schema changes seamlessly.


            4. Cost and Efficiency: As mentioned earlier, Auto Loader is more cost-effective
            and efficient at scale due to its ability to process files in multiple
            batches. It minimizes the number of operations required to discover files,
            resulting in lower costs and faster ingestion.


            In summary, if you have a high volume of files and anticipate scalability
            challenges, Auto Loader is the recommended choice. However, if you have
            a smaller number of files and a consistent data schema, COPY INTO can
            be a suitable option.

            Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring provides the following types of analysis:
            time series, snapshot, and inference. Time series analysis compares data
            distributions across time windows, allowing users to specify the granularities
            over which to calculate metrics. Snapshot analysis monitors how the full
            contents of the table change over time, calculating metrics over all data
            in the table. Inference analysis is used to monitor the performance of
            a machine learning model by attaching the monitor to an inference table
            that holds the model's inputs and corresponding predictions.

            a table in Databricks, you create a monitor attached to the table. To
            monitor the performance of a machine learning model, you attach the monitor
            to an inference table that holds the model’s inputs and corresponding
            predictions. Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring provides the following types
            of analysis: time series, snapshot, and inference. Profile type Description
            Time series Compares data distributions across time windows. You specify
            the granularities over which to calculate metrics (for example, 1 day)
            to compare how your data distribution changes over time. This type of
            profile requires a timestamp column. Snapshot In contrast to time series,
            a snapshot profile monitors how the full contents of the table change
            over time. Metrics are calculated over all data in the table, and monitor
            the table state at each'

            Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring provides three types of analysis: time
            series, snapshot, and inference.


            1. Time series analysis: This type of analysis compares data distributions
            across time windows. You can specify the granularities (such as 1 day)
            over which to calculate metrics. It helps you understand how your data
            distribution changes over time. To use time series analysis, you need
            a timestamp column in your table.


            2. Snapshot analysis: In contrast to time series analysis, snapshot analysis
            monitors how the full contents of the table change over time. Metrics
            are calculated over all the data in the table, providing insights into
            the table's state at each point in time.


            3. Inference analysis: This analysis is specifically designed for monitoring
            the performance of machine learning models. You attach the monitor to
            an inference table that holds the model's inputs and corresponding predictions.
            Inference analysis helps you track the accuracy and quality of your model's
            predictions over time.


            These different types of analysis enable you to gain valuable insights
            into the behavior and performance of your data and machine learning models
            within the Databricks Lakehouse environment.

            The purpose of a baseline table in Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring is
            to use it as a reference for measuring drift or the change in values over
            time. It is useful when you have a sample of what you expect your data
            to look like, and drift is then computed relative to expected data values
            and distributions. The baseline table should contain a dataset that serves
            as a reference for measuring changes in the primary table over time.

            of the table change over time. Metrics are calculated over all data in
            the table, and monitor the table state at each time the monitor is refreshed.
            Inference A table containing predicted values output by a machine learning
            classification or regression model. This table includes a timestamp, a
            model ID, model inputs (features), a column containing model predictions,
            and optional columns containing unique observation IDs and ground truth
            labels. It may also contain metadata, such as demographic information,
            that is not used as input to the model but might be useful for fairness
            and bias investigations or other monitoring. An inference profile is similar
            to a time series profile but also includes model quality metrics. This

            called the “primary table”, you can optionally specify a baseline table
            to use as a reference for measuring drift, or the change in values over
            time. A baseline table is useful when you have a sample of what you expect
            your data to look like. The idea is that drift is then computed relative
            to expected data values and distributions. The baseline table should contain

            The purpose of a baseline table in Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring is
            to store and track the performance metrics of a system over a specific
            period of time. It serves as a reference point or benchmark to compare
            the current performance of the system against historical data.


            By storing baseline metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, query execution
            time, and other relevant metrics, the baseline table allows users to easily
            monitor and analyze the performance of their Lakehouse system. It helps
            in identifying any deviations from the expected or desired performance,
            enabling proactive monitoring and troubleshooting.


            The baseline table can also be used for capacity planning, trend analysis,
            and identifying patterns or anomalies in the system's behavior. It provides
            valuable insights into the overall health and performance of the Lakehouse
            environment, facilitating informed decision-making and optimization efforts.

            to provide a reference point for measuring drift or changes in values
            over time. A baseline table contains a dataset that represents what you
            expect your data to look like. By comparing the primary table, which is
            the table being monitored, to the baseline table, you can measure the
            extent to which the data has deviated from the expected values and distributions.
            This helps in identifying any anomalies or unexpected changes in the data,

    user_input: How do I read binary files using Databricks Runtime?
    responses:
    -   responder_name: generated_ground_truth_answer
        response_text: >-
            To read binary files using Databricks Runtime, you can use the binary
            file data source. This data source converts each file into a single record
            that contains the raw content and metadata of the file. The produced DataFrame
            includes columns such as `path`, `modificationTime`, `length`, and `content`.
            Additionally, you can specify the data source format as `binaryFile` to
            read binary files. An example of reading binary files is shown below:


            ```python

            # Read binary files


            # Specify the data source format as binaryFile


            # Load binary files


            df = spark.read.format("binaryFile").load("path_to_files")


            # Display the DataFrame


            display(df) # image thumbnails are rendered in the "content" column

            ```
        source:
        - 'Binary file ============= Databricks Runtime supports the binary file data
            source, which reads binary files and converts each file into a single
            record that contains the raw content and metadata of the file. The binary
            file data source produces a DataFrame with the following columns and possibly
            partition columns: * `path (StringType)` : The path of the file. * `modificationTime
            (TimestampType)` : The modification time of the file. In some Hadoop FileSystem
            implementations, this parameter might be unavailable and the value would
            be set to a default value. * `length (LongType)` : The length of the file
            in bytes. * `content (BinaryType)` : The contents of the file. To read
            binary files, specify the data source `format` as `binaryFile` . Images
            -------- Databricks recommends that you use the binary file data source
            to load image data. The Databricks `display` function supports displaying
            image data loaded using the binary data source. If all the loaded files
            have a file name with an image extension , image preview is automatically
            enabled: ```python df = spark.read.format("binaryFile").load("") display(df)
            # image thumbnails are rendered in the "content" column ``` !image preview
            Alternatively, you can force the image preview functionality by using
            the `mimeType` option with a string value `"image/*"` to annotate the
            binary column. Images are decoded based on their format information in
            the binary content. Supported image types are `bmp` , `gif` , `jpeg` ,
            and `png` .'

            To read binary files using Databricks Runtime, you can use the `spark.read`
            API with the `binaryFiles` method. Here's an example:


            ```python

            # Import the necessary libraries

            from pyspark.sql import SparkSession


            # Create a SparkSession

            spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()


            # Read binary files from a directory

            binary_files = spark.read.binaryFiles("/path/to/binary/files")


            # Display the content of binary files

            binary_files.show()

            ```


            In the above example, `/path/to/binary/files` should be replaced with
            the actual path to your binary files directory. The `binaryFiles` method
            reads the binary files as a binary stream and returns a DataFrame with
            two columns: `path` (the file path) and `content` (the binary content
            of the file).


            You can further process the binary files DataFrame as per your requirements
            using Spark DataFrame operations.

            display(df)

            ```


            If all the loaded files have a file name with an image extension, image
            preview is automatically enabled and image thumbnails are rendered in
            the "content" column. Alternatively, you can force the image preview functionality
            by using the `mimeType` option with a string value `"image/*"` to annotate
            the binary column.


            Supported image types for image preview are `bmp`, `gif`, `jpeg`, and
            `png`.

            To schedule a query execution in Azure Databricks, you can use scheduled
            query executions to update your dashboards or enable routine alerts. By
            default, queries do not have a schedule. To set the schedule, you can
            go to the Query Editor, click **Schedule** > **Add schedule** to open
            a menu with schedule settings. Then, choose when to run the query by specifying
            the frequency, period, starting time, and time zone using the dropdown
            pickers. Additionally, you can select **More options** to show optional
            settings such as a name for the schedule and a SQL warehouse to power
            the query. Finally, click **Create** and the query will run automatically
            according to the schedule.

            To schedule a query execution in Azure Databricks, you can follow these
            steps:


            1. Open your Azure Databricks notebook and write the query that you want
            to schedule for execution.


            2. Click on the "Schedule" button located at the top-right corner of the
            notebook interface.


            3. In the "New Job" dialog box, provide a name for your job in the "Job
            Name" field.


            4. Choose the cluster on which you want to run the job from the "Cluster"
            drop-down menu.


            5. Specify the frequency at which you want to run the job using the "Frequency"
            drop-down menu. You can choose options like daily, hourly, or custom.


            6. Set the start time and end time for the job execution using the "Start
            Time" and "End Time" fields respectively.


            7. In the "Command" text box, paste the query that you want to schedule
            for execution.


            8. Click on the "Create" button to create the scheduled job.


            Once the job is created, it will run automatically based on the specified
            schedule. You can view the execution history and manage the job from the
            Azure Databricks job interface.

            To schedule a query execution in Azure Databricks, follow these steps:


            1. In the Query Editor, click on **Schedule** and then select **Add schedule**
            from the dropdown menu.

            2. This will open a menu with schedule settings. Choose when you want
            the query to run.
               - Use the dropdown pickers to specify the frequency, period, starting
            time, and time zone.
               - If you want to edit the schedule using Quartz Cron Syntax, you can
            select the **Show cron syntax** checkbox.
               - You can also choose **More options** to show additional settings
            such as a name for the schedule and selecting a specific SQL warehouse
            to power the query.
            3. After specifying the schedule settings, click on **Create**.

            4. Your query will now run automatically according to the schedule you
            set.


            It's important to note that if an alert uses the same query, the alert
            will run on its own refresh schedule and not use the query schedule. Additionally,
            if a scheduled query fails to execute according to its schedule, you should
            manually trigger the query to ensure it doesn't fail. Azure Databricks
            will automatically retry failed query executions with a back-off algorithm,
            but persistent failures may cause the next retry to exceed the scheduled
            interval.

            To create a visualization in Databricks SQL using a SQL query, you can
            follow these steps:


            1. Open the Databricks SQL interface and navigate to the notebook or workspace
            where you want to create the visualization.


            2. Write a SQL query that retrieves the data you want to visualize. Make
            sure the query returns the necessary columns for your visualization.


            3. Execute the SQL query by running the cell or code block containing
            the query.


            4. Once the query has executed and returned the results, click on the
            "Chart" button located above the query results.


            5. Select the appropriate chart type from the available options, such
            as bar chart, line chart, pie chart, etc.


            6. Customize the visualization by selecting the desired columns for the
            x-axis, y-axis, labels, legends, and any other relevant options.


            7. Click on the "Apply" or "Create" button to generate the visualization.


            8. The visualization will be displayed below the query results in the
            notebook or workspace. You can interact with it, zoom in/out, and download
            it if needed.


            Note: Databricks SQL also provides additional features and functionalities

            To create a visualization in Databricks SQL using a SQL query, you can
            follow these steps:


            1. Run the desired SQL query in the SQL editor. For example:


            ```sql

            USE CATALOG SAMPLES;

            SELECT hour(tpep_dropoff_datetime) as dropoff_hour, COUNT(*) AS num

            FROM samples.nyctaxi.trips

            WHERE pickup_zip IN ({{pickupzip}})

            GROUP BY 1

            ```


            2. After running the query, in the **Results** panel, click the **+**
            button and select **Visualization**.


            3. In the **Visualization Type** drop-down, choose the type of visualization
            you want to create, such as **Bar**.


            4. Enter a name for your visualization, like **Dropoff Rates**.


            5. Review the visualization properties and make any necessary adjustments.


            6. Click **Save** to create the visualization.


            You can then interact with the visualization in the visualization editor
            using tools like the Plotly toolbar, which allows you to perform operations
            like selection, zooming, and panning. Note that if you don't see the toolbar,
            it may have been disabled by your Databricks SQL administrator.

    user_input: How do I implement a UserDefinedAggregateFunction in Scala for Apache
        Spark SQL?

            To implement a UserDefinedAggregateFunction in Scala for Apache Spark
            SQL, you can create a class that extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction.
            This class should override inputSchema, bufferSchema, dataType, deterministic,
            initialize, and update methods. The inputSchema method defines the input
            fields for the aggregate function, while the bufferSchema method defines
            the internal fields for computing the aggregate. The dataType method specifies
            the output type of the aggregation function, and the deterministic method
            indicates whether the function is deterministic. The initialize method
            sets the initial value for the buffer schema, and the update method updates
            the buffer schema given an input.

            To implement a UserDefinedAggregateFunction (UDAF) in Scala for Apache
            Spark SQL, you need to follow these steps:


            1. Import the necessary Spark SQL classes:

            ```scala

            import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.{MutableAggregationBuffer, UserDefinedAggregateFunction}

            import org.apache.spark.sql.types._

            ```


            2. Extend the UserDefinedAggregateFunction class and override its methods:

            ```scala

            class MyUDAF extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction {

              // Define the input schema for the UDAF
              def inputSchema: StructType = StructType(StructField("input", DoubleType)
            :: Nil)

              // Define the buffer schema for intermediate values
              def bufferSchema: StructType = StructType(StructField("sum", DoubleType)
            :: StructField("count", LongType) :: Nil)

              // Define the output schema of the UDAF
              def dataType: DataType = DoubleType

              // Define whether the UDAF is deterministic or not
              def deterministic: Boolean = true

              // Initialize the buffer values
              def initialize(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer): Unit = {
                buffer(0) = 0.0 // sum
                buffer(1) = 0L  // count
              }

              // Update the buffer values with each input
              def update(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer, input: Row): Unit = {
                if (!input.isNullAt(0)) {
                  buffer(0) = buffer.getDouble(0) + input.getDouble(0) // sum
                  buffer(1) = buffer.getLong(1) + 1L                    // count
                }
              }

              // Merge intermediate buffer values
              def merge(buffer1: MutableAggregationBuffer, buffer2: Row): Unit = {
                buffer1(0) = buffer1.getDouble(0) + buffer2.getDouble(0) // sum
                buffer1(1) = buffer1.getLong(1) + buffer2.getLong(1)     // count
              }

              // Calculate the final result
              def evaluate(buffer: Row): Any = {
                buffer.getDouble(0) / buffer.getLong(1) // average
              }
            }

            ```


            3. Register the UDAF with Spark SQL:

            ```scala

            val myUDAF = new MyUDAF()

            spark.udf.register("my_udaf", myUDAF)

            ```


            4. Use the UDAF in your Spark SQL queries:

            ```scala

            val df = spark.range(1, 100).toDF("value")

            df.createOrReplaceTempView("my_table")

            spark.sql("SELECT my_udaf(value) FROM my_table").show()

            ```


            In the above example, the UDAF calculates the average of a column named
            "value" in the "my_table" DataFrame. You can modify the UDAF implementation
            to perform different aggregations based on your requirements.

            To implement a `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` in Scala for Apache Spark
            SQL, you need to extend the `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` class and override
            its methods. Here's an example:


            ```scala

            import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.MutableAggregationBuffer

            import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.UserDefinedAggregateFunction

            import org.apache.spark.sql.Row

            import org.apache.spark.sql.types._


            class GeometricMean extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction {
              // This is the input fields for your aggregate function.
              override def inputSchema: org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType =
                StructType(StructField("value", DoubleType) :: Nil)

              // This is the internal fields you keep for computing your aggregate.
              override def bufferSchema: StructType = StructType(
                StructField("count", LongType) ::
                StructField("product", DoubleType) :: Nil
              )

              // This is the output type of your aggregation function.
              override def dataType: DataType = DoubleType

              override def deterministic: Boolean = true

              // This is the initial value for your buffer schema.
              override def initialize(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer): Unit = {
                buffer(0) = 0L // count
                buffer(1) = 1.0 // product
              }

              // This is how to update your buffer schema given an input.
              override def update(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer, input: Row): Unit
            = {
                buffer(0) = buffer.getAs[Long](0) + 1
                buffer(1) = buffer.getAs[Double](1) * input.getAs[Double](0)
              }

              // This is how to merge two objects with the bufferSchema type.
              override def merge(buffer1: MutableAggregationBuffer, buffer2: Row):
            Unit = {
                buffer1(0) = buffer1.getAs[Long](0) + buffer2.getAs[Long](0)
                buffer1(1) = buffer1.getAs[Double](1) * buffer2.getAs[Double](1)
              }

              // This is where you output the final value, given the final value of
            your bufferSchema.
              override def evaluate(buffer: Row): Any = {
                math.pow(buffer.getDouble(1), 1.toDouble / buffer.getLong(0))
              }
            }

            ```


            In this example, we create a `GeometricMean` class that extends `UserDefinedAggregateFunction`.
            We override several methods to define the input schema, buffer schema,
            data type, and behavior of the aggregation function.


            To use this `UserDefinedAggregateFunction`, you need to register it with
            Spark SQL. Here's an example of how to register and use it:


            ```scala

            import org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession

            import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._


            val spark = SparkSession.builder()
              .appName("UDAFExample")
              .master("local")
              .getOrCreate()

            // Register the UDAF

            val geometricMean = new GeometricMean()

            spark.udf.register("geometric_mean", geometricMean)


            // Use the UDAF in a SQL query

            val df = spark.range(1, 10).toDF("value")

            df.createOrReplaceTempView("myTable")


            spark.sql("SELECT geometric_mean(value) AS result FROM myTable").show()

            ```


            In this example, we register the `GeometricMean` UDAF as a function named
            "geometric_mean" using `spark.udf.register()`. Then, we can use the UDAF
            in a SQL query by calling the registered function.

            To register a User-Defined Aggregate Function (UDAF) with Spark SQL, you
            need to follow these steps:


            1. Create a class that extends the `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` abstract
            class. This class represents the UDAF and defines the logic for initialization,
            updating, merging, and finalizing the aggregation.


            ```scala

            import org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.{MutableAggregationBuffer, UserDefinedAggregateFunction}

            import org.apache.spark.sql.types.{DataType, LongType, StructType}

            import org.apache.spark.sql.Row


            class MyUDAF extends UserDefinedAggregateFunction {
              // Define the input schema
              def inputSchema: StructType = ???

              // Define the buffer schema
              def bufferSchema: StructType = ???

              // Define the output data type
              def dataType: DataType = ???

              // Define whether the UDAF is deterministic or not
              def deterministic: Boolean = ???

              // Initialize the buffer
              def initialize(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer): Unit = ???

              // Update the buffer based on a new input row
              def update(buffer: MutableAggregationBuffer, input: Row): Unit = ???

              // Merge two buffer values together
              def merge(buffer1: MutableAggregationBuffer, buffer2: Row): Unit = ???

              // Calculate the final result of the aggregation
              def evaluate(buffer: Row): Any = ???
            }

            ```


            2. Implement the methods of the `UserDefinedAggregateFunction` abstract
            class to define the input schema, buffer schema, output data type, determinism,
            initialization, updating, merging, and finalization logic.


            3. Register the UDAF with Spark SQL by calling the `register` method on
            a `SparkSession` object.


            ```scala

            val spark = SparkSession.builder
              .appName("UDAF Example")
              .getOrCreate()

            val myUDAF = new MyUDAF()

            spark.udf.register("my_udaf", myUDAF)

            ```


            4. Now, you can use the registered UDAF in Spark SQL queries.


            ```scala

            val df = spark.read.table("my_table")

            df.createOrReplaceTempView("my_table_view")


            val result = spark.sql("SELECT my_udaf(column) FROM my_table_view")

            result.show()

            ```


            Replace `"my_udaf"` with the desired name for your UDAF, and replace `"column"`
            with the column on which you want to apply the UDAF in your query.


            That's it! You have successfully registered and used a UDAF with Spark
            SQL.

            To register the UDAF with Spark SQL, you can follow the steps below:


            1. Create an instance of your UDAF class. For example, if your UDAF class
            is named `GeometricMean`, you can create an instance like this: `val gm
            = new GeometricMean`.


            2. Use the `register` method of the `udf` object in Spark SQL to register
            the UDAF. Pass in a name for the UDAF and the instance of your UDAF class.
            For example: `spark.udf.register("gm", gm)`.


            After registering the UDAF, you can use it in your SQL queries or DataFrame
            operations by referencing the name you assigned during registration.
