            Lo siento, parece que me equivoqué en mi respuesta anterior. Para obtener
            la fecha y hora de la última modificación de una tabla en Databricks utilizando
            R, puedes utilizar la función `dbutils.fs.ls()` para obtener información
            sobre el archivo de la tabla y luego extraer la fecha y hora de la última
            modificación de la información.


            Aquí te dejo un ejemplo de cómo hacerlo:


            ```R

            # Ruta de la tabla

            ruta_tabla <- "/ruta/a/tu/tabla"


            # Obtener información sobre el archivo de la tabla

            info_archivo <- dbutils.fs.ls(ruta_tabla)


            # Extraer la fecha y hora de la última modificación

            fecha_modificacion <- info_archivo$modificationTime


            print(paste("La tabla fue modificada por última vez en:", fecha_modificacion))

            ```


            Ten en cuenta que esta función solo está disponible para tablas que se
            han creado en Databricks. Si estás utilizando una tabla externa, como
            una tabla de una base de datos relacional, es posible que esta función
            no esté disponible.

    user_input: What is the cron syntax to run a job every 15 minutes

            To run a job every 15 minutes, you can use the following cron syntax:
            `*/15 * * * *`. This means that the job will run every 15 minutes, at
            every hour, every day of the month, every month, and every day of the
            week. You can find more information about cron syntax in the [Quartz Job
            Scheduler CronTrigger Tutorial](https://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html)
            documentation.

            Databricks Runtime includes Apache Spark, but it also adds a number of
            components and updates that substantially improve the usability, performance,
            and security of big data analytics. So while Databricks Runtime includes
            Spark, it is not the same as Spark.

            To connect Power BI Desktop to Azure Databricks, you can use Partner Connect
            or connect manually. Partner Connect is a faster way to connect to a cluster
            or SQL warehouse from Power BI Desktop in just a few clicks. To use Partner
            Connect, make sure your Azure Databricks account, workspace, and the signed-in
            user meet the requirements for Partner Connect, then click the Partner
            Connect button in the sidebar and choose the Power BI tile. In the Connect
            to partner dialog, choose the name of the Azure Databricks compute resource
            that you want to connect and download the connection file. Open the downloaded
            connection file, which starts Power BI Desktop. Enter your authentication
            credentials and click Connect. Select the Azure Databricks data to query
            from the Power BI Navigator.


            If you prefer to connect manually, follow the instructions in the documentation
            depending on your chosen authentication method. To connect faster with
            Power BI Desktop, use Partner Connect.

            I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any documentation on how to turn on dark
            mode in Databricks. However, you can try going to your user settings by
            clicking on your profile picture in the top right corner of the screen
            and selecting "User Settings". From there, you can check if there is an
            option to enable dark mode.

    user_input: uninstall databricks and remove from path in web terminal
    responses:

        response_text: >-
            To uninstall the Databricks CLI and remove it from the path in the web
            terminal, you can run the following command:


            ```

            databricks unconfigure --token

            ```


            This command removes the authentication token and clears the configuration
            file. If you want to completely remove the CLI, you can also delete the
            CLI installation directory. The default installation directory is `/usr/local/bin/databricks-cli`.
            You can delete it by running the following command:


            ```

            sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/databricks-cli

            ```


            Note that you need to use `sudo` to delete the directory because it is
            owned by the root user.

    user_input: Does Delta Live Tables support Unity Catalog?

            Yes, Delta Live Tables support for Unity Catalog is in Public Preview.
            You can use Unity Catalog with your Delta Live Tables pipelines to define
            a catalog where your pipeline will persist tables and read data from Unity
            Catalog tables. Your workspace can contain pipelines that use Unity Catalog
            or the Hive metastore. However, a single pipeline cannot write to both
            the Hive metastore and Unity Catalog, and existing pipelines cannot be
            upgraded to use Unity Catalog.

            To reference a secret in your notebook or job, you can use the Secrets
            utility (dbutils.secrets). Here's an example of how to use it:


            ```

            # Get the secret value

            dbutils.secrets.get(scope="<scope-name>", key="<secret-name>")

            ```


            Replace `<scope-name>` with the name of your secret scope and `<secret-name>`
            with the name of your secret. This will return the value of the secret,
            which you can use in your code.


            For more information on how to use the Secrets utility, you can refer
            to the following documentation: https://docs.databricks.com/security/secrets/secret-workflows.html#use-secrets-in-notebooks-and-jobs

            To create a subfolder in your database, you can use the `CREATE DATABASE`
            command with the `LOCATION` parameter to specify the path of the subfolder.
            Here's an example:


            ```

            CREATE DATABASE my_database.my_subfolder

            LOCATION '/mnt/my_mount_point/my_subfolder'

            ```


            This creates a subfolder named `my_subfolder` inside the `my_database`
            database, with the location set to `/mnt/my_mount_point/my_subfolder`.
            You can replace these values with your own database name, subfolder name,
            and location path.

        response_text: "You can import data from SharePoint using the Databricks SharePoint\
            \ connector. The SharePoint connector is a custom connector that you can\
            \ use to read data from SharePoint lists and document libraries. \n\n\
            To use the SharePoint connector, you need to first create a SharePoint\

    user_input: How does Delta Live Tables work?

            Delta Live Tables is a declarative framework for building reliable, maintainable,
            and testable data processing pipelines. Instead of defining your data
            pipelines using a series of separate Apache Spark tasks, you define streaming
            tables and materialized views that the system should create and keep up
            to date. Delta Live Tables manages how your data is transformed based
            on queries you define for each processing step. You can also enforce data
            quality with Delta Live Tables expectations, which allow you to define
            expected data quality and specify how to handle records that fail those
            expectations. When you trigger an update, Delta Live Tables starts a cluster
            with the correct configuration, discovers all the tables and views defined,
            and creates or updates tables and views with the most recent data available.

            Delta Live Tables is a change data capture (CDC) solution for Databricks
            that allows you to update tables based on changes in source data. Delta
            Live Tables supports updating tables with slowly changing dimensions (SCD)
            type 1 and type 2. To perform CDC processing with Delta Live Tables, you
            first create a streaming table, and then use an `APPLY CHANGES INTO` statement
            to specify the source, keys, and sequencing for the change feed. For syntax
            details, see [Change data capture with SQL in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/sql-ref.html#cdc)
            or [Change data capture with Python in Delta Live Tables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/delta-live-tables/python-ref.html#cdc).

    user_input: How do I use databricks secrets?

            To use Databricks secrets, you can store your credentials in a secret
            scope and reference them in your notebooks and jobs. Here are the steps
            to set up secrets:


            1. Create a secret scope. Secret scope names are case insensitive.

            2. Add secrets to the scope. Secret names are case insensitive.

            3. If you have the Premium plan, assign access control to the secret scope.


            You can use the Secrets utility (dbutils.secrets) to reference secrets
            in notebooks and jobs. For more information, you can refer to the following
            resources:

        response_text: "Para criar uma tabela a partir de arquivos JSON, é necessário\

            I'm sorry, but the documentation I fetched does not provide information
            on how to reset the web terminal. However, you can try closing the web
            terminal panel and reopening it to see if that resolves the issue. If
            that doesn't work, you can try refreshing the page or logging out and
            logging back in to your Databricks workspace. If the issue persists, you
            may need to contact Databricks support for further assistance.

            I'm sorry, I couldn't find any information in the documentation that directly
            addresses the issue you're experiencing. However, you can try detaching
            and re-attaching the notebook as suggested in the error message. This
            may help resolve the issue. If the problem persists, you can try restarting
            the cluster or contacting Databricks support for further assistance.

    user_input: How can I view cluster metrics in realtime?

            To view cluster metrics in real-time, you can use the native cluster metrics
            tool in the Azure Databricks UI. Clusters that use Databricks Runtime
            13.0 and above have access to these metrics by default. To access the
            cluster metrics UI, click **Compute** in the sidebar, then click on the
            compute resource you want to view metrics for, and finally click the **Metrics**
            tab. Hardware metrics are shown by default. To view Spark metrics, click
            the dropdown labeled **Hardware** and select **Spark**. You can also select
            **GPU** if the instance is GPU-enabled. The metrics are collected every
            minute, and you can filter them by any range of day, hour, or minute from
            the last 30 days.

    user_input: Help create a personal access token to cmpute cluster

            To create a personal access token for a compute cluster in Databricks,
            you can follow these steps:


            1. Click on the "Clusters" icon in the left sidebar of the Databricks
            workspace.

            2. Select the cluster for which you want to create a personal access token.

            3. Click on the "Edit" button at the top of the cluster details page.

            4. Scroll down to the "Advanced Options" section and click on the "Permissions"
            tab.

            5. Under "Token Management", click on the "Generate New Token" button.

            6. Enter a name for the token and select the desired expiration time.

            7. Click on the "Generate" button to create the token.

            8. Copy the token value and store it in a secure place.


            You can use this personal access token to authenticate with the cluster's
            REST API or to run Databricks CLI commands. Note that the token is only
            displayed once, so make sure to copy and store it securely.

            You can use the Databricks SQL Connector for Python to connect to SQLite
            files. You can find more information about how to use the connector in
            the [Databricks SQL Connector for Python documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/data/data-sources/sql-databases/sqlite.html#use-the-databricks-sql-connector-for-python).
